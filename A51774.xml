            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The Subject is indeed one of the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that hath happened upon the Stage of the World of late Ages; where <hi>Kings,</hi> were both <hi>Agreſſors</hi> and <hi>Defendants.</hi> And this may in ſome ſort war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant its Dedication to that Monarch, who is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpire of the <hi>Controverſies</hi> of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hough my deſign at firſt was but to deſcribe the Siege of <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> and its acceſſorys, as wil appear by ſome paſſages in this narrative: Yet upon ſecond thoughts, and to gratifie the curious, if this jejune Relation find any ſuch; I have judged it proper to add a ſummary of thoſe tranſactions which were previous to it, deducing the whole War from its original to that laſt Treaty which put a period to ſo many and ſo eminent calamities.</p>
               <p>The ancient emulation and jealouſie betwixt the two Crowns of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> the reſult of their neighbourhood, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent broyles, have been much heightned by the <hi>Swediſh</hi> acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in <hi>Germany;</hi> For having joyned <hi>Pomerania</hi> and <hi>Bremen</hi> to their former Dominions; they have in a manner encloſed and beleagured <hi>Denmark,</hi> which rendered them ſo uneaſie to the <hi>Danes,</hi> that theſe ſeemed to deſire nothing more than an opportunity, not only to recover the Dutchy of <hi>Bremen,</hi> and what they had loſt by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Bromsbro</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianople,</hi> to wit, <hi>Halland, Jempterland, Gothland,</hi> and the <hi>Oeſel,</hi> but alſo to enlarge their own limits, and ſecure themſelves for the future from the further incroachments of their growing neighbours. And now a ſo wiſhed for occaſion did fairly preſent it ſelf; for <hi>Charles Guſtave</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi> being deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ingaged in <hi>Poland,</hi> had carried with him the flower of the Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh Souldiery to ſerve in that expedition; ſo that whilſt he was buſie in the conqueſt of other Countries, he did in ſome ſort expoſe his own. Nor did the <hi>Danes</hi> omit ſo favourable a juncture, but muſtering their grievances into a <hi>Manifeſt</hi> (too long to inſert) which they publiſhed, leaſt they ſhould be thought to be rather invited by the favour of the occaſion, than neceſſitated by any provocations or injuries.</p>
               <p>They had beat up their Drums about the beginning of the year
<pb n="1" facs="tcp:104469:5"/>1657. and their preparations for war were carried on with unuſual pomp and hopes of ſucceſs: Their proceeding was likewiſe formal, for they denounced war by a Herauld at Arms ſome months before they entred into the Liſts, which proved ruinous to them; for they thereby gave the enemy time, not only to fortifie againſt the enſuing tempeſt, but King <hi>Charles</hi> leiſure enough to come with his Army out of <hi>Poland</hi> to ſhew them the fault they had committed in letting ſlip that which is moſt precious and moſt irrecoverable. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> ſet all their Engines on work, their interceſſion and their threats to ſtave off the <hi>Danes,</hi> but to no purpoſe: For the occaſion was too fair, and their preparations too forward to deſiſt; ſo that their Miniſters were roundly anſwered, that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had long expected ſatisfaction from the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Reſident of the ſaid Crown was retired without giving any, his Majeſty was obliged to endeavour his own ſatisfaction and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by the way of Arms.</p>
               <p>The truth is, the party was not ill concerted, for the <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burger</hi> was already drawn off from the <hi>Swediſh</hi> alliance, and upon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance given him from the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Court, that the Soveraignty of the Ducal <hi>Pruſsia</hi> ſhould be conferred upon him (which he alſo now enjoys) he confederated himſelf with the <hi>Pole</hi> and <hi>Dane</hi> againſt <hi>Sweden.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> were alſo highly engaged, for that wary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick reflecting upon King <hi>Charles</hi> his progreſs in <hi>Pruſſia</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and fore-ſeeing what obſtructions his continued conqueſts in theſe parts might bring to their Eaſtern Traffick, reſolved to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him; which they not only did by ſending a fleet and 1300 Foot to ſecure <hi>Danſick,</hi> but alſo by this powerful diverſion of the <hi>Danes,</hi> to which they contributed vaſt ſumms of monys, eſpecially thoſe of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> upon the ſecurities of the Cuſtoms in the <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>Norway.</hi>

               <p>The King of the <hi>Romans,</hi> at preſent Emperour, had alſo an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hovering about the Swediſh frontiers in <hi>Pruſsia</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> which put King <hi>Charles</hi> to a ſtand, not knowing which to turn himſelf; yet reſolved to fall with his whole power upon the firſt that broke out, fancying that he was ſtrong enough to deal with either of them apart (and it was impoſſible they ſhould joyn at the diſtance they were at) whereas he ſhould be too weak both for the one and the other if he divided his Forces. He was at <hi>Thorn</hi> in <hi>Pruſsia</hi> in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the motion of theſe new Adverſaries, where he at length heard the news of the <hi>Danes</hi> invading of him in the Dutchy of <hi>Bremen</hi> and the Frontiers of <hi>Sweden.</hi> And this ſeems a ſecond error, for either they ought to have begun ſooner whilſt the King was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with ſo many enemies in <hi>Poland,</hi> or they ought to have ſtayed longer, and expected until the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> had made the firſt attempt, ſo that they then ſhould have had nothing to combat with but Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Fortreſſes. The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was ſo tranſported with the firſt notice of this breach, that amongſt other expreſſions of rage and ſcorn he was heard to ſay: <hi>Frederick, Frederick, I will ſtick ſo cloſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:104469:5"/>to thee, that I will ſink with thee.</hi> It may be reaſonably imagined that for all this appearing violence, he was ſecretly glad of this rupture with the <hi>Danes;</hi> for it did not only in ſome ſort juſtifie his invading of <hi>Poland,</hi> the Truce being not yet expired, by their example; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo gave him an opportunity to quit that Country with honor, which he would otherwiſe have been forced to leave of himſelf. He had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed wholly maſtered that great Kingdom by his valour and the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of the Nobility there, many of which he had gained by his own and the Vice-Chancelors <hi>Radizeuski</hi>'s practiſes and intelligence, having forced all to ſwear fealty to him, though they all left him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with the ſame levity, but with more juſtice, being they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the obedience and ſervice of their own Prince again; ſo that he was weary of that War, as being engaged in too vaſt a Territory, and ſo far from his Confines. He had obliged <hi>Ragotski</hi> Prince of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania</hi> to be of his party, who had alſo entred <hi>Poland</hi> with a very great Army; but he ſuffered him to be loſt by expoſing him: for though they had joyned forces together, yet he drew his off, being he could not draw the enemy to battle and marched towards <hi>Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> whilſt the other was deſigned to return home, which for want of conduct he could not compaſs: having loſt his whole Army, his hopes in <hi>Poland</hi> (being no leſs than a Crown) and afterwards his whole Country by that unfortunate expedition.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> being therefore reſolved to quit the <hi>Poliſh</hi> War, left his Brother Prince <hi>Adolph,</hi> in <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> for the defence of that Province, which he mainly deſired to conſerve: In ſo much that he had made offer of the Crown of <hi>Poland</hi> (being <hi>Ragotski</hi> failed of it) to the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> himſelf, provided he might keep <hi>Pruſsia;</hi> Count <hi>Steinbock</hi> to obſerve the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> and <hi>Poles;</hi> his Brother in law Count <hi>Magnus de la Guarde</hi> in <hi>Leifland</hi> againſt <hi>Muſcovy</hi> and <hi>Lithuania;</hi> and marched himſelf (laying all in aſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, to ſecure his Rear from the purſuit of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Cavalry) with about 6000 Horſe towards <hi>Pomerania.</hi> He had in vain ſollicited the Duke of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> to lend him ſome Troops, though he had offered him <hi>Thorn, Elbing,</hi> and <hi>Marienburg</hi> as cautions, provided he might leave <hi>Swediſh</hi> Officers in them. Being therefore obliged to ſtand upon his own bottom, he came to <hi>Stetin,</hi> whence he wrote to all the Electors, eſpecially him of <hi>Mentz</hi> as moſt addicted to <hi>France;</hi> complaining of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> invading of him in the Empire, which was againſt the tenor of the inſtrument of Peace; and beſought his counſel and aſſiſtance. Whilſt the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> haſtens thus by Land towards <hi>Denmark,</hi> the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> being advertiſed, (though falſly) that he took his journey by water, put to Sea in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with his whole Fleet; and coaſting the Countrey of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> came to <hi>Danſick,</hi> where he underſtood the truth of King <hi>Charls</hi> his motion, which obliged him after a fruitleſs ſurvey of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, to return in great haſt to <hi>Coppenhagen.</hi> Whilſt the <hi>Swedes</hi> were on their way towards <hi>Holſtein,</hi> part of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> forces had taken <hi>Bremerford,</hi> a good place in the Dutchy of <hi>Bremen,</hi> and two other

But the <hi>Swedes</hi> under fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the darkneſs, and ſome falſe Allarms in other places, broke down this wooden Fence, and ruſhing in on that part up to the Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle skirts in water, wheeled about the Baſtion and entred the Town rendring themſelves Maſters of the ſame, without any conſiderable reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>This victory equalled a gained battle, for they made above 2000
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:104469:6"/>priſoners (beſides the ſlain which amounted to as many more) well nigh 200 Officers, 33 Colours and above fourſcore pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, with other ſtore of Ammunition and plunder. This ſucceſs rendred them alſo abſolute Maſters of <hi>Holſtein,</hi> except <hi>Krempen</hi> and <hi>Gluckſtadt,</hi> and <hi>Renſbourg;</hi> gave them the plunder and contribution of all <hi>Jutland,</hi> and the communication betwixt the North and Eaſt Seas by the leſſer <hi>Belt.</hi> It was thought ſtrange that ſo ſtrong a place as <hi>Fredericks-ode,</hi> and ſo well provided with Garriſon and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, ſhould be taken by a number ſcarce equal to them within. <hi>Andrew Bilde</hi> Marſhal of the Kingdom, was Governour of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant place: but whether he loſt it by his fate, or by his folly; by his cowardiſe, or by his treaſon is ſtill diſputeable. However it was, it coſt him his life, he being mortally wounded in the attack, which did not yet ſuffice to clear his memory from obloquie and a ſuſpition of diſloyalty. The <hi>Swedes</hi> themſelves contributed much, though accidently to this rumour, for they ſent his body richly veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without ranſom over into <hi>Funen,</hi> which encreaſed the ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports or him; though it might as well have been thought an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their generous humanity, as his perfidie, as they will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after evince in the perſon of Vice Admiral <hi>De Witt,</hi> ſlain in the <hi>Sound,</hi> and returned with no leſs honour and pomp.

               <p>But leaving the <hi>Danes</hi> to their diſſentions, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> poſted in their new conqueſts; let us ſtep back a little to take a ſhort view and proſpect of the civil tranſactions contemporary with the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>England</hi> had too great an intereſt in the <hi>Baltick,</hi> which may not improperly be called the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> of the North, to ſit ſtill without making reflection upon the great commotions in thoſe parts: And beſides the concerns of a free and undiſturbed Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce; <hi>England</hi> being at that time in an open War with <hi>Spain,</hi> had much rather that the Swediſh Arms had been at liberty to give a check to the other <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Branch in <hi>Germany,</hi> than to have been diverted by a Warre with <hi>Denmark:</hi> Upon this account two Gentlemen are made choice of to endeavour a Reconciliation betwixt the two Kings. Mr. <hi>Meadowe</hi> being ſent to the Court of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Jepſon</hi> to that of <hi>Sweden.</hi> The former arrived in <hi>Denmark</hi> in the beginning of <hi>September</hi> 1657. much about the time that the <hi>Swede</hi> entred <hi>Jutland.</hi> He was received far above his Character, being that of Envoy Extraordinary, to the regret of other forreign Miniſters: But the conjuncture of time and affairs obliged the <hi>Danes</hi> by all poſſible waies and means to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiate
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:104469:7"/>themſelves with the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> So that the Envoyes Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition for a Mediation, after he had declared the ruinous effects of a War,<note place="margin">

The <hi>Dane</hi> declaring that he was ready to enter upon a Treaty of a ſure and honourable peace under the Mediation of <hi>England;</hi> and that ſo ſoon as the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhould teſtifie a ſuitable concurrence on his part. This Declaration was tranſmitted to the <hi>Swede</hi> with all poſſible diligence, and drew from him a reply dated at <hi>Wiſmar,</hi> in <hi>October</hi> following; in which offer many expoſtulations how injuriouſly he had been dealt with,<note place="margin">19. 1657.</note> intermixt with ſome language, which the <hi>Dane</hi> reſented as oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious: He declares likewiſe his aſſent to enter upon a Treaty under the Mediation of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and that the preliminaries as to place of treating, number of Commiſſioners, ſale conducts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be adjouſted according to the tranſactions betwixt the two Crowns in the year 1644. upon the confines of the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</p>
               <p>This reply produced another Declaration from the <hi>Dane.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

He further takes notice of the conquiſite delays and difficulties made by the <hi>Dane,</hi> by intermixing the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of others which have no reference to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> War. Yet that he is willing to grant his ſafe conducts to ſuch Confederates of the <hi>Danes</hi> as ſhall be deſirous to be preſent at a treaty in any place of the Confines. And for the States general, after they ſhall have ratified the Treaty made at <hi>Elbing</hi> and thereby renewed their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer friendſhip with <hi>Sweden;</hi> in caſe they offer to him their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, he would ſo declare himſelf, that they ſhould have no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of complaint.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:104469:7"/>To this the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> rejoyned another anſwer,<note place="margin">27. <hi>Dec.</hi>
                  </note> inſiſting upon the immediate admiſſion of the States General to the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without the previous qualification of firſt ratifying the <hi>Elbing</hi> Treaty; a point which had already been depending a whole twelve-month, and was like to depend longer: adheres to the place for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly nominated for both ſides to meet at, and preſſes that the <hi>Pole</hi> and <hi>Brandenburger</hi> his Confederates ſhould not only have the bare liberty of being preſent at the Treaty, but that the reſpective Treaties to be had with them ſhould proceed by the ſame ſteps and means as that with <hi>Denmark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the place of the Treaty the intrigue was this: the <hi>Dane</hi> would have the meeting at <hi>Lubec</hi> or any other neutral place in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> where the <hi>Poliſh</hi> and <hi>Brandenburg</hi> Miniſters might be preſent as parties with the <hi>Dane</hi> in the ſame War. On the other ſide; the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> would have it upon the Frontiers betwixt the two Kingdoms on the other ſide the <hi>Baltick,</hi> whither he knew the <hi>Pole</hi> and <hi>Brandenburger</hi> could not eaſily come; thereby to diſunite the <hi>Pole</hi> and <hi>Dane</hi> by the jealouſie of a ſeparate Treaty. And perhaps at the ſame time treating openly with the <hi>Dane,</hi> and under-hand with the <hi>Pole,</hi> and they two ſtriving to prevent each other in the peace; where he ſaw the moſt advantagious conditions proffered him there clap up a peace and proſecute the War againſt the other. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this the Mediatours endeavoured to draw from the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> an intimation of what terms and conditions he would reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied within the enſuing Treaty; that ſo when the Commiſſioners came to meet, they might have little more to do, than to ſign and ſeal; and the buſineſs be effected as ſoon as reported; with inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of conditions of this Nature. A general Amniſty for what was paſt, Reſtitution of places taken each upon other: A ſolemn Reverſal under good Garanties of the peace in 44. And a way o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened for redreſſing the <hi>Gravamina,</hi> particularly thoſe relating to the trade of the <hi>Baltick,</hi> and for preventing defraudations of the Duties in the <hi>Sound,</hi> which were the pretended cauſe of the War. And to diſpoſe the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> to diſ-joyn his intereſts from <hi>Poland,</hi> it was repreſented to him what a broken Reed <hi>Poland</hi> had proved to him, ſometimes making proffer to paſs their Forces over the <hi>Oder,</hi> and then preſently retreating again, upon pretence of joyning the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Foot; not ſo much as entring <hi>Pomerania</hi> all this while to give the <hi>Swedes</hi> the leaſt diverſion. That the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Alliance were mutual and reciprocal, which not being performed on the <hi>Poliſh</hi> part, his Majeſty of <hi>Denmark</hi> was no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er obliged. That Confederacies were for mutual ſafety, and not intended to oblige Princes to periſh either ſingly or in company. That he had the freſh Example of his Heroick Father, who though he had entred into an Alliance with the Proteſtant Princes of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> yet the neceſſity of his affairs, to recover what was loſt,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:104469:8"/>contrained him to make a peace with the Emperour, in the year 1629. excluſive to his Allies.</p>
               <p>But neither did theſe reaſons prevail with the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> to depart from his alliance with the <hi>Pole,</hi> till a more preſſing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity afterwards extorted from him a ſeparate treaty. Nor was the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> willing to anticipate the treaty by Declaring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before hand as to the Conditions, nor to content himſelf in the Conditions with leſs than an honourable compenſation, for the pretended injury the <hi>Dane</hi> had done him: But that ſince the <hi>Dane</hi> had made him dance ſo long a march from <hi>Poland</hi> to <hi>Jutland,</hi> he was reſolved at leaſt to make him pay the Fidlers.</p>
               <p>Thus the War of the Cabinet was managed by paper miſſives and memorials, but that of the field was carried on at another rate; for whilſt the active <hi>Swedes</hi> omitted nothing for the proſecuting of their Conqueſts, they gave out they would beſiege the remaining Fortreſſes of <hi>Holſteyn,</hi> and ſeemed to hearken to ſuch overtures of peace as were made to them the better to amuſe the <hi>Danes,</hi> whilſt they ſecretly prepared their Bridges, Waggons, Sleads, Hurdles, and the like neceſſaries to paſs over the Ice into the Iſles. They were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure on the <hi>Holſteyn</hi> ſide, no enemy appearing to diſturb them; for the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> though reconciled to the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> had not yet openly broke with <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied at the ſieges of <hi>Cracow</hi> and <hi>Thorn.</hi> Only the <hi>Poles</hi> not unmindful of the favour the <hi>Danes</hi> had done them, by drawing the burthen of the War (which had well-nigh overwhelmed their Country) upon themſelves, out of intereſt, or gratitude, or both; ſent <hi>Charneski</hi> with 12000. Horſe to their aſſiſtance. Theſe troops paſt the <hi>Oder</hi> in order to their march towards <hi>Holſtein;</hi> but hearing of the taking of <hi>Fredericks-Ode</hi> advanced no farther, but having pillaged and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaged the Country, returned back into their own, having effected nothing but the ruine of a great number of Villages and poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. As the <hi>Swedes</hi> were frighted with this cavalcade of the <hi>Poles,</hi> ſo the <hi>Danes</hi> had alſo been with the arming of the circle of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Saxons</hi> for the recovery of <hi>Bremerford,</hi> as a part of the Empire, pretending to keep the peace of the ſame (as is already mentioned) and the removal of all hoſtility out of its bounds. But the troops theſe raiſed amounting to 4000. diſperſed without a blow, occaſioned as well by their own Diviſions, as the open diſſenting of the Duke of <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> a Prince of that circle, and Brother in Law to the King of <hi>Denmark;</hi> ſo that they, as well as the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Auxiliaries, only appeared and Meteor-like threatned and vaniſhed. But the <hi>Swedes</hi> having got all things in a readineſs to attempt <hi>Funen,</hi> the heavens alſo ſeemed to contribute to their Deſigns; for the cold was ſo intenſe, and violent beyond the memory of man, that not only leſſer Rivers and Fountains froze up, but the Sea it ſelf became paſſable, being covered with an unuſual, but ſolid bridge of Ice. King <hi>Charles</hi> was too prudent to let ſlip any opportunities which

Not a night paſſed wherein he did not ſend his Spies into the Iſland, and his Scouts to diſcover the firmneſs of the congealed Waters, which being at length reported to be ſtrong enough, ſave only a ſmall but long rent of ſcarce five foot broad, he gave orders to march; commanding great quantity of planks, poſts, hurds and the like materials to make a bridge over the ſaid breach, to be firſt brought thither and laid. Two troops of <hi>Waldechs</hi> Regiment fell in, the Ice breaking, and ſeveral other ſingle troopers were drowned, which forced the Army to ruſh on with more vigour, being too far ingaged to retire, and the danger behind them being greater than that in their front. The <hi>Danes</hi> made ſome though no great oppoſition, for being bravely charged, they were eaſily broke, routed and ſlain, ſcarce two hundred of them eſcaping: the King purſued them that fled ſo cloſe, that he overtook <hi>Guldenlewe</hi> who was ſick in his Coach not far from <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſea,</hi> in which town the chief of the Iſland, he alſo ſurpriſed five Daniſh Senators, and ſeveral other fugitives, ſo that he became abſolute Maſter of this wealthy Province and the whole power of the Enemy in it, which conſiſted of well with 5000. Souldiers and armed Boores, ſixty pieces of Cannon and great Magazines of all ſorts of military proviſions.</p>
               <p>'Tis not unworthy the remembring, that this adventrous march over the Frozen Seas, was the reſolve of the King himſelf at a Councel of War againſt the ſenſe of his chief Officers, who cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it of too much temerity. And ſince it proſpered well, 'tis due to the honour of that Kings Name, which had it otherwiſe ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would have aſperſed his memory.</p>
               <p>The news of the loſſe of <hi>Funen</hi> being arrived at <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſo much the more of terrour and apprehenſion with it, becauſe beſides the loſs of ſo important an Iſle, the like Bridge, which had let the <hi>Swede</hi> over the little <hi>Belt</hi> into <hi>Funen,</hi> might ſerve to paſs him over the great <hi>Belt</hi> into <hi>Zeland.</hi> Hereupon the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſends for Mr. <hi>Meadowe</hi> deſiring him to ſet a Treaty on foot with all poſſible expedition, which he did,<note place="margin">

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:104469:9"/>How he was willing to enter preſently upon a Treaty under the reſpective Mediatours of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England;</hi> and being it was left to him to appoint the place, he gave the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> the choice, either of the Iſle of <hi>Spro,</hi> or of <hi>Ruakoping</hi> in <hi>Langland</hi> for the Commiſſioners of both ſides to meet in, within eight daies. That together with the preſent Letter he had ſent ſafe conducts as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired: And that the buſineſs required the greater haſte, foraſmuch as he could promiſe no ſecurity to himſelf in a ſuſpenſion of Arms.</p>
               <p>This was a clear anſwer and conceſſion as to the deſired treaty but he would not be complemented our of his advantages by a ceſſation of Arms, knowing well that nothing more facilitates a conqueſt than a pannick terror incuſſed by the ſuddenneſs of an invaſion, and that the only way to profit upon it, is to give no reſpite for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting thoſe Spirits which the firſt impreſſions of fear had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> King marches inceſſantly. His neareſt way to <hi>Zeland</hi> had been over the great <hi>Belt,</hi> from <hi>Newbourg</hi> to <hi>Corſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But he takes that of <hi>Langland,</hi> ſo to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> then to <hi>Falſter,</hi> which though much the further, yet was the ſafer; becauſe the traject from Iſland to Iſland was no where ſo broad as that in the great <hi>Belt;</hi> And he would ſecure all behind him.</p>
               <p>They were not idle this while at <hi>Coppenhagen.</hi> The <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſafe conducts being delivered, the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Commiſſioners together with the Engliſh Mediatour journeyed with what diligence they could to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Rydcoping.</hi> They had travelled little more than ſixty miles Engliſh, when not far from <hi>Wardenburg</hi> or <hi>Warburg,</hi> the laſt town upon <hi>Zeland</hi> from <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> they met with the <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſcouts by whom they were advertiſed that their King was newly entred upon <hi>Zeland</hi> and not far behind. And ſoon after they met the King himſelf in a Sledge at the head of 200 <hi>Finniſh</hi> Horſe. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible diligence was altogether ſurprizing to the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners. All alighting out of their Sledges (the manner of travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Northern Countrys) to ſalute him; His Majeſty did the ſame, and willing them to paſs on to the neighbouring town, and that he would ſpeedily be with them: For that he was going on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take view of a ground where he might moſt conveniently draw his Army into battalia. To <hi>Warburg</hi> they went, and there the Treaty firſt began, where they alſo met the <hi>Chevalier Terlon</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour of <hi>France,</hi> who came in company with the <hi>Swediſh</hi> King; The Commiſſioners on the part of <hi>Sweden</hi> were Count <hi>Ulefelt</hi> a diſcontented <hi>Dane,</hi> who had a long time refuged himſelf in the Court of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Steno Bielke</hi> a Senatour of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſtaid no longer at <hi>Warburg</hi> than was neceſſary for drawing over his Army, and then ranging them in Batralia in a large extended Front in view of the <hi>Danes</hi> to make them appear more numerous at laſt marched off in the direct way to <hi>Coppenhagen.</hi> 'Twas uncomfortable treating whilſt the King was marching, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104469:9"/>the Mediatours and Commiſſioners not being willing to be left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, adjourned the Treaty, and breaking up thence overtook the King at <hi>Keuk</hi> four leagues from <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> who the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drew up in Battalia again, and then drew off as before in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly march towards <hi>Coppenhagen.</hi> The number of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was about 7000. Horſe and Foot and ſome few Field-pieces, with which he took up his quarters within two leagues of the City; of which he would often ſportingly ſay, ſhe was a fair Bride and deſerved dancing for, and not without reaſon neither, for had he won <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> as he woo'd her, ſhe had brought him for her Dower all <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Norway,</hi> and then without the tedious enumeration of his particular principalities, he might for his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial ſtyle and title have wrote himſelf, <hi>King of the North.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Mediatours and Commiſſioners went to a near adjoyning Village called <hi>Toſtrup</hi> there to draw up the abſtract or minutes of the Treaty, which when mutually agreed on, all hoſtility was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to ceaſe. In the mean time it will not be impertinent to take a ſhort view of the poſture and condition of <hi>Coppenhagen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Fortifications of the City were much decay'd, partly through ſecurity, not having ſeen an Enemy in an hundred years, partly through Parſimony to avoid an expence ſuppoſed needleſs: Beſides, that great trading Towns are not over willing to be fetter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Walls and Baſtions: And perhaps the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Nobility were as to this caſe leſs willing than they of <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> for fear the ſtrength of the City ſhould make the Burgers heady. The walls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Earth only, had been much crumbled down with the froſt and time, and were ſcaleable without Ladders; neither could they uſe the Spade at that time the earth being ſo petrified with the cold. There were no Cannon upon the Walls when the Commiſſioners parted from <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> but by this time good ſtore were drawn from the Ships and mounted upon Ship carriage. The truth is, the City was full of men, the Burgers and ſuch as fled out of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, beſides five or ſix hundred Horſe and ſome Foot which were drawn from <hi>Schonen,</hi> but they wanted proviſions and forrage to hold out a long ſiege: But nothing diſmay'd the <hi>Dane</hi> more, than that none of their Confederates was in a capacity to help them: For the <hi>Pole</hi> and <hi>Brandenburger</hi> were too remote, and the Ice which was a Bridge to the <hi>Sweed,</hi> was a Bar to the <hi>Hollander:</hi> Add to this the temper of the people, ſome murmuring againſt their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, others crying out they were betrayed, and all affrighted and irreſolved: Only this teſtimony is juſtly due to the perſon of the King, that he comported himſelf with a magnanimous conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy amidſt all adventures. Some think if the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had been truely informed of the condition of the Town, he would have attempted the taking of it: But though he knew all was not well with the <hi>Dane,</hi> he did not know the worſt; and it may be he thought the hazard too great to attack ſo great a City with ſo little an Army. Perhaps he would tempt Fortune no further, but eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:104469:10"/>it a prudent choice, rather to cloſe with preſent and certain ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, than to catch at things future and contingent, eſpecially ſuch as depend upon the iſſues of War, than which no humane thing is more ſubject to viciſſitude.</p>
               <p>The Minutes of the Treaty were in few daies concluded at <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrup,</hi> upon which a ceſſation of Arms followed, and from thence the Mediatours and Commiſſioners removed to <hi>Rotſchild</hi> there to digeſt them more at leiſure into the body of a Treaty, which being done,<note place="margin">

               <p>Thus this pacification was concluded and Signed, which diveſted King <hi>Frederick</hi> of the beſt Provinces of his Kingdom, which would have coſt much blood, and many years to have conquered; of great part of his Army, to be employed ere long againſt himſelf; and of his reputation, the beſt jewel of Princes; which he will yet reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver when he is out of the apprentiſhip of his Nobles, and reduced to that extremity, that nothing but his own magnanimity can ſupport him.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide, If the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> were a great loſer by what he quitted, it may be well ſaid he was a great ſaver if we conſider what he kept. For he who had loſt all in the Field, could not reaſonably expect to regain it upon the Carpet: And though ſome of his principal branches were lopt off, which through time may grow again, yet the root was preſerved, for had that been loſt all had gone without reſourſe: So that I eſteem it only as an expreſſion of kindneſs towards his King and Country, that of the <hi>Daniſh Ryxhoffmaſter,</hi> a perſon of eminent merit, who immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before he was to Sign the Treaty whiſpered into the ear of one near him, thoſe words of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour, <hi>Utinam neſcirem Literas.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Since Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his ſacred Majeſty here.</note> And upon this accompt and in gratitude for his good offices the King was pleaſed to admit Mr. <hi>Meadowe</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Envoy into the Order of <hi>Denmark.</hi> This Treaty thus concluded and ratified, the next thing which followed was the ſolemn Enterview betwixt the two Kings at <hi>Fredericksburg</hi> a ſumptuous Palace of the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> about four Leagues from <hi>Coppenhagen:</hi> Thither both of them went, and which is remarkable without any previous ſtipula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, concerning guards or number of followers uſually practiſed upon ſuch occaſions; but with a frank and Northern ſimplicity, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not miſtruſting or not willing to miſtruſt each other.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Frederick</hi> met his new gueſt who came from <hi>Rotskild</hi> ſome two miles from his houſe: Both Kings being at a competent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance alighted out of their Coaches at the ſame time, and approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on foot ſaluted each other by joyning their right hands with all the reſpect and obliging demonſtrations of kindneſs immaginable; and now as if their late enmity had been entirely forgot, they both entred the ſame Coach, being the <hi>Daniſh,</hi> firſt the <hi>Swede,</hi> then the <hi>Dane,</hi> accompanied by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mediatour and the Duke of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:104469:11"/>
                  <hi>Holstein Sunderburg,</hi> and ſo rode to <hi>Fredericksburg,</hi> where they were received and entertained with as much magnificence as the place and ſeaſon could afford. At Table the Queen of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſate at the boards end, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> on the ſide at her right hand, as being the gueſt, and next below him on the ſame ſide the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> Were that <hi>Roman</hi> to deſcribe this entertainment, who affirmed that the ſame wiſdom was requiſite for ordering a feaſt as for diſciplining an Army; he would be more large in the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it than I ſhall be. Let it ſuffice to ſay that the method was exact, the proviſion ſumptuous, and the ſolemnity rare, to ſee two Kings at one Table, who had ſo little before been in Arms one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the other. And it was not unpleaſant that thoſe Trumpets and Kettle-Drums which ſo lately denounced Death ſhould now be made uſe of, as loudly to proclaim Healths. The Solemnity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued from Thurſday to Saturday, both Kings for two nights lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the ſame Roof: At parting they exchanged Horſes, and other Preſents, and thoſe Officers of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Court who were particularly appointed to attend the <hi>Swediſh</hi> King, were nobly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galed by him. On Saturday he took his leave and went to <hi>Elzineur</hi> the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> accompanying him part of the way; from thence he paſt the <hi>Sound</hi> through the noiſe and ſmoak of the Cannon of the two Caſtles of <hi>Cronenburg</hi> and <hi>Elzenburg,</hi> to take poſſeſſion of his freſh conqueſts in <hi>Schonen;</hi> where he was entertained by his new Subjects, with more pomp than paſſion, more ſtate than affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; the ſenſe of their wonted obedience being yet too green to be ſo ſoon forgot. He did not ſtay long there but went to <hi>Gottenburg</hi> to meet his Queen, as alſo to deliberate with his Senate and rejoyce with his friends over his late ſucceſſes.</p>
               <p>And thus the Scene of Affairs being changed in <hi>Denmark,</hi> a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene calm did enſue, but not laſt long: However, the <hi>Swedes</hi> did pretend to treat a new and ſtricter Alliance betwixt the two Crowns.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Swediſh</hi> Army was to continue in <hi>Denmark</hi> till the firſt of <hi>May,</hi> where they lived with the uſual rapines and diſorders of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting Victors; which muſt yet continue longer than the deſigned time for their removal. The Danes thus low were forced to a quick execution of the Treating, as fearing to diſpleaſe their new friends; who yet complained of delays and evaſory and non-performance. Moſt of the two thouſand Horſe were run away, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended was by colluſion, and the Governour of <hi>Bremervord</hi> made difficulty to deliver up that place, which he will yet part with too ſoon. But that which vext the <hi>Sweeds</hi> moſt, was that the Danes refuſed to enter into a Treaty Offenſive and Defenſive with them. The main deſign of the <hi>Swedes</hi> herein was the ſtopping of the <hi>Sound,</hi> which <hi>Van Beuning</hi> the Dutch Embaſſadour then in <hi>Denmark</hi> well obſerving, preſented a memorial to the King, deſiring him, that whereas by the third Article of the Treaty of <hi>Rotſchild,</hi> that both Crowns ſhould endeavour to hinder all Hoſtile Fleets
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:104469:11"/>from entring into the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, that the ſaid Article ſhould not be underſtood of the ſhips of the Lords the States General, being it directly oppoſed the league formerly made betwixt them and the <hi>Daniſh</hi> crown. The ſaid Embaſſadour had upon the fabricking of this Article, likewiſe declared againſt it; but <hi>Denmark</hi> was then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to yield to demands much more prejudicial, and of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to it ſelf, not being in a condition to mind the intereſts of others, where their own did ſo eminently ſuffer. The King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> had ſent two Commiſsioners to <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> to urge this mutual confederation, but they could not bring the <hi>Danes</hi> to it, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced new and more intricate difficulties, for the <hi>Swedes</hi> complained openly of the <hi>Danes</hi> delays, and the <hi>Danes</hi> of the <hi>Swedes</hi> not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing their forces out of their Countries, as they had promiſed. One pretext ſeemed to beget another, and one obſtacle was no ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner removed but new ones appeared, eſpecially on the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſide, who at length declared, they could not withdraw their Army out of <hi>Denmark</hi> until they had entire ſatisfaction. Their chief pretences were the compleating of the 2000 horſe, they having received no more than 936 moſt <hi>Danes,</hi> whereas they ſhould have been all <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> the poſſeſſion of the little Iſle of <hi>Ween</hi> as belonging to <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,</hi> 400000 ryxdollers in conſideration of the loſs they ſuſtained by <hi>Henry Carloff</hi> (who had carried one of their <hi>Guinea</hi> ſhips, laden with a quantity of Gold and Elephants teeth into <hi>Gluckſtat,</hi> after the making of the peace) and other no leſs conſiderable points, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the late treaty. But moſt of theſe difficulties were cleared or remitted to the mediation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, and now all ſeemed to tend to a perfect underſtanding. By this time, the King and Queen of <hi>Sweden</hi> were come into <hi>Holſtein,</hi> from whence they went to <hi>Wiſmar,</hi> a convenient Port to tranſport the Queen back to <hi>Stockholm</hi> at pleaſure. The King returned to <hi>Oldeſlo,</hi> the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral rendezvous of his troops, where he gave audience to ſeveral Embaſſadors; the neighbouring States, and Towns, and Princes, being jealous of his great preparations and deſignes, which jealouſie was augmented by the daily boaſtings of his Officers, who ſeemed to threaten all, whileſt the truth lay cloſlier concealed. <hi>Denmark</hi> alone ſeemed to have no reaſon to fear, having not only delivered <hi>Bremervorde,</hi> but conſented almoſt to every thing that was required of them to content the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and get them out of their Country; well-nigh ruined with their extorſion and in-quarterings. But they will not be gone ſo, and now ſmile at the <hi>Daniſh</hi> credulity, whileſt they prepare to poſſeſs the whole, and render their King one of the greateſt Princes of <hi>Europe.</hi> The pretexts for this ſecond War<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were plauſible enough; as appears by the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Manifeſt, and the Kings own ſpeeches in the enſuing narration. But the <hi>Danes</hi> accuſed <hi>Charls</hi> his boundleſs ambition, and cried out plainly, and not without proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, that he had already devoured the dominion of the Eaſt ſea in his thoughts; which was not to be compaſſed but by the preceding conqueſt of <hi>Denmark.</hi> They further affirmed, that he had therefore
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:104469:12"/>been perſwaded at <hi>Gottenburg,</hi> to proſecute the enlargement of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Empire by new acquiſitions. The conflict would be eaſie, and as the firſt was, bloodleſs. He ſhould but go and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and by the acceſſion of his future victories, open a paſſage to his farther greatneſs. Add to theſe, the tried difficulties of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> war, the quiet but armed condition of <hi>Germany,</hi> the peaceful inclinations of <hi>France</hi> at that time, but above all, a warlike Prince (and as he pretended provoked and injured) environed with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious Army, and it will not ſeem ſtrange that the fury of the threatning tempeſt fell upon <hi>Denmark.</hi> But whatever the cauſes were, the war was eaſier begun than ended, whileſt the <hi>Danes</hi> ſerve for a memorable example to poſterity, how valid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair is, and that there is nothing proof againſt an enforced ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> were obliged, as is already obſerved, by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Rotſchkild,</hi> to withdraw all their forces out of all the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Denmark,</hi> by the firſt of <hi>May;</hi> which they did not only not do, for <hi>Holstein, Jutland, Funen,</hi> and the Dukedom of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> were ſtill in their power, but took alſo new councils, to invade and conquer the reſt of that divided Kingdom. The King then being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to renew the war, prepared all that was judged neceſſary for ſo great an expedition, and that with no leſs ſecrecy than prudence; and truly it was no wonder that the <hi>Danes</hi> were ſurpriſed (being by ſeveral Embaſſies, letters and meſſages lull'd into ſo ruinous a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity) when as the Miniſters of divers Princes who then followed the Court, were ſo far from penetrating into its deſignes, that they had not the leaſt ſuſpicion of a ſecond invaſion upon <hi>Denmark.</hi>

The noiſe therefore of this invaſion ſled to <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> before him, and filled the Court and City with the terrour of ſo imminent a danger. All was full of fear and confuſion, and the people then at divine ſervice (for it was upon the Sabbath day in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning) ſtruck with the apprehenſions of their approaching ruine, which they look'd upon as infallible, if the enemies made that haſt they might, and aſſaulted the City, then deſtitute of order or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to withſtand them. The ſlight of the country-people, who came ſlocking into the town, magnifying the number and progreſs of the enemy according as their fears ſuggeſted, redoubled the terrour; in ſo much, that all dreading their deſtruction as unavoidable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought how beſt to ſecure themſelves.

Many preferring their perſonal ſecurity to that of their Country, cried out for peace, and a recourſe to the conquerours clemency: but the wiſeſt, and they were but few, perſwaded a vigorous reſiſtance, and exhort the reſt rather to commit their common ſafety to God, and a juſt defence, than to the arbitration of a cruel and inſulting enemy. Neither were the diſorders and apprehenſions at Court inferiour to theſe, until the King himſelf, having rejected the advice of thoſe, who would have perſwaded him to preſerve himſelf for better times, by a timely retreat into <hi>Norway,</hi> or <hi>Holland,</hi> had declared, with a magnanimity truly royal; That he <hi>would live and dye in his Neſt, and not ſurvive the ſate and glory of his Country.</hi> The following letter, though not ſigned, fell as was informed into his hands, the which as being of an extraordinary nature, merits to be inſerted; it was as followeth.</p>
               <p>Sir, <hi>Notwithſtanding my being engaged in the ſervice of your mortal Enemy, I am a very affectionate well-wiſher to your Majeſty.

               <p>I will leave the diſquiſition of the author, the contriver, and the intrigue of this letter to the curious, and only add, that if he had followed the advice of moſt part of his Councel, he had
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:104469:13"/>hearkened to that of his kind enemy, and loſt his kingdom into the bargain. But he being more generouſly reſolved, did by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple raiſe the drooping ſpirits of them about him, which quickly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in their countenances, and expreſſions. Shame and emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a deſire of revenge, had maſtered thoſe weaker paſſions their fear had begot in them before; ſo that at preſent there was none amongſt them, that did not ſeem full of courage and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, againſt the unjuſt proceedings of the enemy. The Court being thus appeaſed, and confirmed; the King commanded the trumpet to ſound to horſe, and quick meſſengers to be diſpatched into the Country, to allarm thoſe horſe that were quartered in the neighbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Villages, and order their ſudden coming to Town, which they did with ſo much diligence, that they prevented the enemies ſpeed and precaution. In the mean time, the Magiſtrates and chief amongſt the Citizens were ſent for, and enquiry made, what was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from them in ſo imminent a danger? The King having ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated the ambition and perfidie of the Enemy, added, that they were not now to ſight for the recovery of what they had loſt, but leſt they ſhould loſe (which he abhor'd to think on) what they had yet remaining, and become the prey and ſcorn of their inſulting foes. The Lord <hi>Gerſtorf</hi> great Maſter of the kingdom, proceeded to tell them, That there was nothing more glorious for generous ſpirits, than bravely to maintain that duty, and that fidelity, which they owed by nature and oath, to their King and Country. They were now reduced to that extremity, that they muſt defend themſelves or periſh; there being no mean betwixt the Enemies ambition, and their ſlavery. He did therefore exhort them in his Majeſties name, to unity and concord amongſt themſelves, to ſight like men, to arm all that could bear arms, and to refuſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There were ſome who had apprehended, that the Citizens fears might ſurmount their loyalty; which they having underſtood, proteſted by the mouth of their chief Burgomaſter <hi>John Nanſen,</hi> that they would expoſe their lives and what ever was dear to them, for the defence of their King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and by an example worthy to be transferred to poſterity cried out, <hi>They would dye his Majeſties ſubjects.</hi>

He viſited the guards in

But that he might haſten thoſe ayds he had ſo ſeriouſly aſſured them off, and leſt his paſſage might be cut off by the <hi>Swediſh</hi> fleet already in ſight, he immediately went on board, and ſet ſail for <hi>Holland</hi> in a man of war, which lay ready in the haven for his tranſport. <hi>Owen Joel</hi> a <hi>Daniſh</hi> Gentleman, was ſent by the King along with him, but deputed to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> to complain of this unjuſt invaſion of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and to invite him alſo to his ayd and ſuccour. Theſe Embaſſadors toucht upon the Coaſts of <hi>Norway</hi> in their paſſage, and landing at <hi>Flecker,</hi> acquainted the Governour by word of mouth, and the Kings Officers farther off by Letters, of the renewing of the wars in <hi>Denmark,</hi> admoniſhing them to ſtand upon their guards, as well againſt the ſurpriſes, as the open violence of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> now their declared enemies.

Van Beuning</hi>'s arrival quickned theſe preparations, for having demonſtrated the danger <hi>Denmark</hi> was in, and the Kings earneſt deſires for the haſtening of the ſuccours, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it was impoſſible for the City to hold out much above ſix weeks.</p>
               <p>Hereupon all imaginable ſpeed and care was taken, to forward the deſigned ſupplies, neither could the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Miniſters then in <hi>Holland,</hi> with all their skill (however they magnified their Maſters affection and amity towards the States General) divert them from their taken reſolution. Nay, the King himſelf having diſmiſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſeventy of their Merchants ſhips, which he had ſurpriſed in the <hi>Sound,</hi> wrote to them the 21 of <hi>Auguſt</hi> out of his Camp,<note place="margin">

But all this was to no purpoſe; for the States ſenſible what danger might accrew to their Eaſtern traffick (nay many of them judged it quite ruined if <hi>Denmark</hi> were loſt (and the very ſhip-fraught alone was eſtimated at three hundred and fixty thouſand pound ſterling a year) if the two <hi>Northern Crowns</hi> were united under one Prince, reſolved to hinder it by ballancing their forces, and aiding ſtill the weaker; ſo that they did not only not change their reſolutions, but commanded the voted ſupplies to be made ready with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſpeed; and in the mean time, ſent ſeveral expreſſes to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to aſſure him of the ſudden comming of their

The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was Maſter of the field, and would ſuddenly be of their fortreſſes and towns too; they ſhould therefore have recourſe to their ſoveraign remedy. What could it ſignifie to ſubjects how their Prince was called? or of what uſe was the ſound of a few ſyllables, it was therefore equal to them, whether <hi>Charles</hi> or <hi>Frederick</hi> were their King. There was one God who was the diſpoſer of Empires, and it ſeemed <hi>Denmark</hi>'s fatal hour was now drawing near. He would not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, pray to the King of Kings, that ſo noble a City as <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> was, might not be deſtroyed, and ſo many thouſands of perſons involved in it's ruines. The <hi>Swedes,</hi> when they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and taken poſſeſſion of the whole Kingdom, would abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly manifeſt the juſtice of their proceedings to all men. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors being diſmiſſed with this ſevere meſſage, were upon the point to depart, when it was told them again, that if they were ſollicitous about the event of this preſent expedition, they ſhould make ſuch propoſitions to the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Embaſſadours, then reſiding in <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> as might be conformable to the preſent ſtate of their affairs, and the condition they were then in. The Embaſſadours being returned to the City, and having acquainted their King with what had paſſed in their negotiation, applied themſelvs to the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador Monſ. <hi>Bielke,</hi> then in reſtraint; demanding him, whether he had any inſtructions to treat about peace? which he denying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they reſolved, as they wrote in their letters to the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour then in the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Camp, to commit their cauſe and its deciſion to God alone. The ſaid <hi>Swediſh</hi> Embaſſadour, was in the mean time in no little danger through the peoples fury, who believing that he, under the colour of friendſhip had betrayed them into this war, however he ſolemnly proteſted to be altogether a ſtranger to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters preſent proceedings, and not to have had the leaſt knowledge of this invaſion. Which is more then probable, being <hi>Coyet</hi> his Colleague, who was returned to his Maſter ſome days before, had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:104469:15"/>left papers of conſequence, and a good ſum of moneys behind him, which fell into the <hi>Danes</hi> hands. But neither theſe excuſes, nor his ſtanding upon his guard in his lodgings, whither all the <hi>Swedes</hi> then in Town were fled for Sanctuary, could have ſaved him, if the King had not upon his requeſt taken him into his protection, and ſecured him in <hi>Roſenburg,</hi> a houſe of pleaſure in the Kings garden; where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained under cuſtody (notwithſtanding the <hi>Swedes</hi> objecting of the breach of the law of Nations by his detenſion) until he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward delivered thence by the interceſſion of the Mediators of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> &amp; <hi>Holland,</hi> eſpecially the laſt. All hopes of Peace being now laid aſide, the <hi>Danes</hi> prepare for war with ſo much the more vigor. They burn the ſuburbs, which they had hitherto ſpared, &amp; omitted nothing they thought requiſite for their defence. By this time, the <hi>Swedes</hi> troops were advanced within ſight of the Town, and ſeeing the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs on fire, could not chooſe but wonder, that they who but a while ſince, armed &amp; in a warlike poſture, had not refuſed peace upon ſuch mean conditions, ſhould now unarmed, and deſtitute of any real force to defend themſelves, not deſpair of their ſafety. King <hi>Charles</hi> obſerving the enemies countenance, made a ſtand till all his army was come up, and then ſeiſed upon the two Forts of <hi>Wartew</hi> and <hi>Ladegard,</hi> which joyned by continual works and trenches together, extending alſo on both ſides to the ſea, environed the whole ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs: and now his Navy, conſiſting of 28 men of War were in ſight, and commanded to anchor before the Town, ſo that the City was environed by ſea and land, and ſhut up from all entercourſe from without. But before I begin to deſcribe the particulars of this famous ſiege, I have thought it not impertinent to ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the original, increaſe, and preſent ſtate of this City, the Metropolitan of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and one of the beautifulleſt of the whole North.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> the royal ſeat of the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Kings, called by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants <hi>Kiobenhaven,</hi> that is to ſay, the <hi>Merchants-haven;</hi> is ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Eaſt ſide of the Iſland of <hi>Zeland,</hi> under the 56 degr. of Northern latitude. This Town was in its beginnings very mean, a few fiſhermens Cottages; but in ſucceſſion of time grew to that greatneſs, by reaſon of the excellency of the haven, that it is at this preſent, moſt juſtly ranked amongſt the moſt noble Cities of the North. Many of its Kings, eſpecially <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the fourth; the memory of whoſe vertues is ſtill cheriſhed by the inhabitants, ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this their reſidence with many notable priviledges and publick buildings. This <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> having laid the foundation of a new Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Iſle of <hi>Amack,</hi> joyned it to the old by a bridge, and called it by the name of <hi>Chriſtians-haven.</hi> He built alſo a goodly Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine houſe, and ſtrengthened the City on the Iſland-ſide with walls and bulworks, but theſe fortifications neglected, and well-nigh fallen in the long peace they had enjoyed, were now repaired. The Moats were cleanſed and deepned, and new works being added to the old where they were defective, the Land-ſide was encloſed
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:104469:16"/>with ten whole, and two half bulworks, the reſt of the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, lying betwixt the Cittadel and the Weſtern part of the Town, is environed with the ſea, which extending it ſelf South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, divides the Kings Palace, a fabrick of ancient ſtructure, from the Iſland of <hi>Amack</hi> by a narrow inlet, making the moſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and capacious haven, as alſo the moſt ſafe againſt all winds of the whole <hi>Baltick</hi> ſea <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> hath as well as other great towns, felt the various viciſſitudes of fortune. The <hi>Lubeckers</hi> having pillaged it twice, conſumed it once with fire. <hi>Jarimarus</hi> Prince of <hi>Rugen,</hi> the <hi>Sweaes;</hi> and the <hi>Hanſe Towns,</hi> ravaged it by turns, though theſe laſt, in the year 1427 upon another attempt, were beaten off with much loſs. Neither hath this City been only oppreſſed by ſtrangers, it hath laboured alſo under the miſeries of civil diſſenſions, for taking part with <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the ſecond againſt <hi>Frederick,</hi> it was taken by <hi>Frederick,</hi> and in the year 1530, after a years ſiege, and the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of famine and war, forced to ſurrender it ſelf to <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the third. After that it enjoyed the ſweets of peace for a long ſeries of years, until <hi>Charles Guſtave</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi> made war upon it, who had alſo ſubdued it, if the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Brandenburgers,</hi> the <hi>Imperia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> the <hi>Poles,</hi> the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and almoſt whole <hi>Europe</hi> had not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened to its ſuccour, as concerned in its conſervation, and reſcued it out of the hands of that victorious Prince. But of theſe in order.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> his ſea and land forces being, as we have already mentioned, met before the Town, ſeiſed upon the Caſtle of <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tow,</hi> and <hi>Ladegard,</hi> as alſo the other out-works, without reſiſtance; for the Citizens ſollicitous for the main, and not ſufficing for all had contracted their forces within their walls. He omitted the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain aſſaulting of the City, having been certainly enformed of the enemies deſperation and multitude, reſolved to periſh rather than change maſter. Being therefore over-born by the advice of his chief Officers, he was forced to prolong the ſiege; but leſt he ſhould leave any place behind him out of his power, he divided his Army, and ſent Marſhal <hi>Wrangel</hi> with part of it, to beſiege the ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Cronenburg,</hi> which commands the <hi>Sound;</hi> not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly fancying by taking of it, to deter forreign forces from coming to relieve <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> or at leaſt, to be the better able to hinder and oppoſe them if they ſhould attempt it.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> being rendred more wary by ſo many loſſes, omitted the preſent attacking of the town, to ſecure and fortifie their own quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; they therefore ſtrengthen the out-works the Citizens had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly quitted; with palliſadoes they turn their breaſt-works againſt the town, and in them, and their ditches or moats (dividing them near the ſea, and cutting them off from the reſt of the ſaid works) they made a quarter large enough to contain all their foot, and all their inſtruments of war. This quarter was ſtrengthened within with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:104469:21"/>a ravelin, and on the ſide towards the fields with a <hi>tenaille,</hi> or tonge; and being alſo ſcated betwixt the ſea and St. <hi>George</hi>'s lake, was ſecured on the back ſide by the right wing of horſe, which lay in the <hi>Hollands</hi> village. The reſt of the horſe (except the guards diſpoſed of upon the ſeveral avenues of the town) were enquarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red betwixt <hi>Utterſleve</hi> and <hi>Wartow</hi> in the open field, ready in caſe the Citizens ſhould ſally again, to oppoſe them upon their firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. The <hi>Danes</hi> were no leſs buſie on their ſide; they cut down all the trees which which were in the Queens garden or elſe where planted, as well for ornament as uſe, without their gates; they burnt ſuch edifices as were yet ſtanding, and level their very rubbiſh with the ground, leſt the enemy might find any ſafety or ſhelter behind them. Things being thus ordered on both ſides, the <hi>Danes</hi> full of hopes, and encouraged by their former good fortunes, prepare for another ſally, but being upon the point to march, they were ſtayed by the ſudden appearance of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> horſe deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the hill from <hi>Walbuy.</hi> This unexpected ſight did not only break their preſent deſign, but filled them with amazement and jealouſie, whileſt moſt of them apprehended there might be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon amongſt themſelves, and a ſecret correſpondence with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from within. But not knowing how that might be, the town being ſo well guarded, and at a loſs who to ſuſpect, an uncertain rumour was ſpread abroad, that a ſtandard had been ſeen lift up, and diſplayed upon <hi>Ulefeld</hi>'s houſe, which all concluded was done to give the enemy notice of what paſſed in the town, by orders from that traytor (as they called him) to his King and Country. But the ſaid lodgings being viſited and ſearched, and ſome who were ſuſpected examined and impriſoned, though nothing got out of them, this ſear vaniſhed. But the true reaſon of this diſcovery was not known till afterwards. There was a Wind mill not far from the town, which over-looked it, though at a diſtance; the <hi>Swedes</hi> having their ſentinels day and night there, could (though confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) by the help of perſpectives, ſee what was done upon the walls, which they within were not at firſt aware of. The <hi>Swedes</hi> having ſecured their quarters, began to infeſt the town by ſhooting multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of glowing bullets into it, eſpecially by night, to add terror to the harm they might do; and indeed the fear was greater than the miſchief, for the King having at the beginning of the ſiege, appointed three hundred men to guard the ſeveral ſtreets of the town, as well againſt ſuch accidents as caſual fires, had abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for any harm that way; which order had that alſo of good in it, that the other Citizens and ſoldiers who were appointed for defence of the ramparts, being ſtrictly enjoyned not to quit their ſtations in any caſe whatſoever, were leſs ſollicitous for their own dwellings, being ſecure in the others care. Theſe men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being provided with great hooks, great tongs made like mens fingers at the ends, and other ſuch inſtruments to handle theſe fire-balls, eaſily prevented their miſchief, ſo that there was no material
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:104469:21"/>harm done, either by them, or by the granadoes thrown into the town, during the whole Seige. And now the <hi>Swedes</hi> began to approach again, but with more circumſpection then at firſt, for they built a large ſquare fort, to defend their trenches, and making uſe of St. <hi>George</hi>'s dike, fortifie it with a breaſt work and palliſadoes, and having raiſed a battery for two and twenty pieces of Cannon upon it, began to thunder upon the remains of the Tower, upon the <hi>Helmer</hi> bullwork and oppoſite <hi>Curtain,</hi> endeavouring by that violence to diſmount the Cannon upon the walls. They alſo made another battery in the <hi>Ladegard</hi> fort, of nine Guns, out of which they ſhot (not only bullets) but fire-balls into the City. The fortifications at <hi>Wartow</hi> being open towards the town, were ſhut up with new breaſt-works, and further ſtrengthened with twelve pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Ordnance. The beſieged had ordered two other Prames with good Cannon in them, to flanck and defend the Eaſt ſide of the town, which they did with ſo much obſtinacy, that the inceſſant violence of the guns out of this ſconce, could not oblige them to quit their ſtations; the covers indeed of theſe flat boats were bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten down, and that was all the harm was done them, which they ſufficiently revenged by diſmounting ſome of the adverſe cannon, and killing ſeveral of their men. The <hi>Danes</hi> ſeeing the enemies order and approaches, and ſeeing no means to diſturb their advance but by ſallies, reſolved yet again to try their fortune that way. They ſtole out of the North gate,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 30.</note> with four hundred horſe and foot, and falling with great haſt and reſolution upon the enemies poſt, on the other ſide the <hi>Bebling</hi> Lake, beat them from it at firſt onſet, but being frighted by their horſe which haſtened to their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, they were forced to retire towards the walls again, leaving behind them one Captain, and fifteen or ſixteen common ſoldiers. This did not daunt them ſo, but they would hazard another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, which five hundred of them ruſhing upon the adverſe approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, performed with much reſolution. They indeed routed theſe next to them, as it is uſual in ſudden ſallies at firſt, but theſe run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways did but ſave themſelves in their ſconces, whereby they not only eluded the endeavours of their purſuers, but being ſuddenly re-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from the neighbouring ſtations, forced them back; mortally wounding two of their Colonels, <hi>Urne</hi> and <hi>Bremer,</hi> who died of their hurts the following day. King <hi>Frederick</hi> eſcaped alſo narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that ſame day: for having ſtood near the Weſt port a good while to ſee the skirmiſhing without, he had no ſooner changed place, but Col. <hi>Lange</hi> ſtepping into it, was ſhot through the breaſt with a muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket bullet, whereof he died ſome few days after. Neither is this the only danger the King hath been in, for Providence (who hath a peculiar care of Princes) protected him from another no leſs emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, ſome time before; He had no ſooner removed himſelf from leaning upon a wall at the ſame Weſt port, but a musket bullet ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pt in that very place, where he had reſted his head but a moment before. The <hi>Danes</hi> ſeeing they could do no more good by their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:104469:22"/>by reaſon of the enemies vigilance and ſtrength, oppoſed new works to their approaches; they made a Ravelin upon the Curtain next the Weſtern gate, with a covered way which extended to both ſides the ſaid gate, and ſtrengthened the <hi>Helmer</hi> Bulwork, the weakeſt place of the whole town, by reaſon of the ſharpneſs of the angle, and the length of the Curtain Northward, exceeding musket ſhot with another Ravelin, againſt the enemies approaches; which they advanced upon the Dike, betwixt the <hi>Bebling</hi> and St. <hi>Georges</hi> lake. The <hi>Swedes</hi> had likewiſe omitted nothing for ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their approaches, they raiſed another redoubt in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and joyned all their quarters with lines of communication. The cannon thundred perpetually on both ſides, and ſcarce a day paſt without skirmiſhing, though with no notable advantage for either party. The City had the worſt of it, for by this time proviſions grew very dear, the publike magazines were empty, and there was no monies in the treaſury, ſo that private men were forced to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the publick charges, by enquartering and feeding the ſoldiery. There was indeed ſtore of wine, of oyl, and of corn, but little or no butter, freſh meats, or fuel; what there was, was regiſtred, as well the wants of the poor, as the better proviſions of the richer Citizens: the hay for the horſes was divided, to each trooper his ſhare a part, for fear the fire might conſume the whole if kept toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the gunpowder was for the ſame reaſon, diſpoſed of into ſeveral quarters of the town. The beſieged bore theſe hardſhips with much conſtancy, being chiefly encouraged by the example of the great ones, eſpecially the King himſelf; who refuſing thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments which diſtinguiſh Princes from the vulgar, was content to ſhare with the ſoldiers in all their hardſhips. The <hi>Swediſh</hi> fleet was by this encreaſed, with a ſupplement of ſix men of war; they had ſunk ſeveral old veſſels in the entry of the haven of <hi>Coppenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> to hinder the paſſage; but yet they could not either do that, or watch ſo narrowly, but ſeveral meſſengers and boats, and ſome little proviſions out of the Iſles, ſtole into the town. Theſe brought the glad tydings of the preparations in the <hi>United Low-Countries</hi> for their relief, of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi>'s marching into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtein</hi> with the <hi>Imperial</hi> and <hi>Poliſh</hi> forces, and how that the <hi>Swedes</hi> had ſurpriſed nothing in that Country upon their firſt breach, ſave the Regiment of Guards already mentioned. Theis news did indeed much quicken the beſieged, until the fatal ſurrender of <hi>Cronenburg</hi> had like to have ſunk them. But we will leave them a while to their grief, well-nigh deſpair, with the apprehenſions they had of the woful conſequences of this loſs; and deliver in ſhort, the ſtory of the taking of this important Fortreſs.</p>

The <hi>Swediſh</hi> Fleet was retired from before the Haven of <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> toward the <hi>Sound,</hi> in whoſe abſence, many leſſer Veſſels, with ſome proviſions, partly out of duty and partly out of deſire of gain, (for they made great profit of their Merchandiſes) ſtole daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Town;<note place="margin">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:104469:26"/>Citizens, was the unexpected arrival of a <hi>Swediſh</hi> Frigat of ſixteen Guns, loaden with ſpoils and prey. The Maſter and Sea-men were <hi>Swedes,</hi> but it happened, that beſides their Lading they had a <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> youth (I would I knew his name) and ſixty <hi>Zeland</hi> Boores on board. The Veſſel having paſſed the Iſle of <hi>Wenen</hi> with full ſail, and in ſight of <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> the young <hi>Dane</hi> ſhewing his Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men the Town with his finger, told them they had a happy oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to deliver themſelves out of their ſlavery, and do their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſome ſervice, if they would reſolutely fall upon the <hi>Swedes</hi> with them, and turn their courſe into the Haven. He had no ſooner ſaid this, but it was reſolved upon, and as ſoon put in execution, for moſt of the Sea-men being under hatches, they eaſily maſtered reſt, and came as they deſigned with full ſail into the Haven. But that which made moſt noiſe in the Town, was the intercepting of a Letter of the King of <hi>Swedens</hi> to <hi>Douglas,</hi> his <hi>General</hi> in <hi>Liefland,</hi> with Orders for the ſeiſing of the Caſtle of <hi>Mithow</hi> in <hi>Coucland,</hi> which he notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding did, as alſo the Duke in it, who with his Lady and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were ſent under ſafe conduct to <hi>Riga.</hi> This violence was ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated with all the circumſtances of infidelity and tyranny, the better to eſtrange the people from any thoughts of an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with ſuch an Enemy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> having brought all their ſtrength before <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> and having enlarged and fortified their Quarters, made all the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of force imaginable; and to ſhew they were in earneſt, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred upon the Town from three ſeveral Batteries at once, with that impetuoſity, that they threw down the point of the Battery at the Weſtern Gate, ſhivered many houſes in Town, and ſlew ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of the Deſendants with their Cannon bullets in one day: to this they added the terrour of their Granadoes, which they toſſed over the Walls in great numbers, but not with that ſucceſs they expected, for they either fell into Pudoles and Mooriſh places, or were prevented before they took fire, by the vigilancy and addreſs of thoſe who were appointed to attend them. The <hi>Danes</hi> repaired by night the Battery the <hi>Swedes</hi> had ſhaken, and diſpoſing of their Cannon (of which they had above 300 in all upon their Walls) in convenient places, rebeat the Enemies Forts and Works, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige them to the like nocturnal labours and reparations. They alſo threw great ſtones out of their Mortars into the Camp, omitting nothing which they thought hurtful or offenſive, ſo that the Siege and attack ſeemed reciprocal, and alternative.<note place="margin">

The <hi>Swedes</hi> repaired the diſorders of the late eruption the ſame night; which the beſiegers obſerving, and heightened with ſo many lucky encounters, flew out upon them again, armed beſides their uſual Weapons, with hand Granadoes.

The ground is very fertile, abounding in Milk, Butter, Cheeſe, Hares, Domeſtick fowl, and all ſorts of Kitchin hearbs, inſomuch that it may properly enough be called, the Cities Store houſe, furniſhing indeed its Markets with thoſe neceſſary commodities; there are ſeveral Villages in it, inhabited partly by <hi>Danes,</hi> and partly by <hi>Dutch,</hi> the latter having been brought thither out of <hi>North Holland,</hi> by the command of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> the ſecond, to make Butter and Cheeſe (as being eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med more skilful in that myſtery than the Natives) above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ſince. The Kings unſeaſonable indulgence, had permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Inhabitants to live at their own Houſes with their Proviſions and Cattle, upon their interceſſions and promiſes, to guard the Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Iſland, and aſſurance that they could not be ſo ſurpriſed, but they ſhould have time enough to retire, and ſend their Cattle and Proviſions, with their Wives and Children before hand into the Town; but they were deceived, for the <hi>Swedes</hi> were upon
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:104469:27"/>them before they were aware, ſo that they had ſcarce time to ſave their own perſons and their Cattle. The <hi>Swedes</hi> being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thus Maſters of the Iſland, began forthwith to fortifie their landing place, and ſecure themſelves a retreat, in caſe the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens ſhould attempt to diſturb them in their new Conqueſt.

The <hi>Danes</hi> therefore ſeeing there was no good to be done upon the Enemy, returned into the Town, but firſt burnt <hi>Sunbug</hi> a Village near the Gate, leſt it might afford them either lodgings or ſhelter. But the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſtay in the Iſland was not long,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 9.</note> for King <hi>Charles</hi> having received certain intelligence that the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Fleet was under ſail, and on its way towards <hi>Denmark,</hi> quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his preſent deſign, with a reſolution to oppoſe the advance of theſe ſuccors. In the mean time, becauſe the Enemy might not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much rejoyce at his departure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he commanded all the Villages and Houſes in the whole Iſland, to be pillaged and burnt, and whatever might be of uſe to the beſieged in his abſence, to be deſtroyed. The <hi>Danes</hi> beheld this ſad ſpectacle from their Walls and Towers with much regret, eſpecially ſuch who were particularly concerned in this devaſtation. But the King knowing bewailings were fruitleſs, reſolved to revenge this violence, being alſo incited to it by the diſorders of the Enemy, he being aſſured by a fugitive out of their Troops, that they being diſperſed through the Iſland, and intent only upon their plunderings, might be eaſily ſurpriſed and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Hereupon the King commands to ſound to Horſe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 10.</note> and all being in a readineſs, marches out himſelf with his own Guards; two hundred and fifty Horſe commanded by <hi>Guldenlew</hi> and <hi>John Alekefeld,</hi> a few Dragoons, and a good Troop for the Reſerve. Some of the nimbleſt Foot got up behind the Troopers, for the buſineſs required expedition, and four light Field-pieces, drawn each of them by ſingle Horſes were carried along. The Senators who were preſent, would have diſſwaded the King from hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his perſon (in whoſe ſafety their all, and their Countries did conſiſt) to the uncertainties of war; but he knowing of what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the preſence of Princes are in ſuch encounters, and hearing that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was alſo in the Iſle in perſon, gave them no hearing, but clapping ſpurs to his horſe continued his way. The <hi>Swedes</hi> being allarmed with this appearance, drew into a Body near a Village called the <hi>Hollands Dorp;</hi> they did not exceed three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Horſe, and thoſe for the moſt part freſh men, and one hundred Foot. The <hi>Danes</hi> finding them in this poſture, charged them brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and after ſome reſiſtance broke and routed them, and had in probability, if they had purſued them cloſely, taken or ſlain King
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104469:28"/>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> himſelf, who together with the Prince of <hi>Sulsbach</hi> and <hi>Wrangel,</hi> were forced to a haſty retreat, leaving above a hundred of their men behind them upon the place. Some few dayes after, the King eſcaped no leſs danger by water, than he had done before by land; For the Boat which he was in, paſſing out of <hi>Zeland</hi> into <hi>Schonen,</hi> ſtriking againſt a Galliot (which by violence of the Wind and ſtream was forced upon him) was broke in pieces. Moſt of his men were drowned, whileſt he catching by the end of a Rope was ſaved, and pulled up into the great Veſſel, with the loſs only of his Hat and Staff. Count <hi>Slippenbach</hi> was alſo with him, but reprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the preſent, though he periſhed afterwards by the ſame Deſtiny.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> content with this Victory, would not endanger the loſing of it by purſuing it, but returned in triumph into the Town, then ſlain and wounded not exceeding thirty in all. The joy was ſo great for this ſucceſs, that they gave publick Thanks in their Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for it; forgetting the juſt ſorrowes they had conceived for thoſe real loſſes they had ſuſtained, being they ſaw themſelves ſo eminently revenged upon the Authors of them. The ſame mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Beſieged had ſallied out with three hundred men upon the Enemies Works by the <hi>Behind Lake,</hi> but found them in ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of defence, that they were forced not only to deſiſt but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. This done, the <hi>Swedes</hi> raiſed a new Battery of eight Guns upon the ſaid Dike, and whileſt it was a building, threw great ſtones and Granadoes out of two Mortar-pieces, without intermiſſion into the Town. Upon the eleventh day, they ſhipped their Troops in <hi>Amak,</hi> and ſet ſail towards the <hi>Sound,</hi> the news of the approach of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Fleet encreaſing daily. The <hi>Danes</hi> made yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſally, after the departure of the Enemy out of <hi>Amak,</hi> with four hundred men, upon the ſquare Fort or Redoubt next the Weſt Gate, and beat the Defendants out of it with Hand granadoes, and other fire-works which they ſhowred into it. They threw down and pull'd out the Turn-pikes and Palliſadoes, which were planted for its ſecurity, and having filled the Trenches with much terrour, retired without the loſs of one man, in ſafety into the Town. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the <hi>Swedes</hi> had endeavoured to approach the City with their whole might, yet the valour of the beſieged was ſuch, that they could do it but ſlowly, and not without much difficulty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by reaſon of the frequent fallies, and unceſſant firings out of the Town. And yet they were got within fifty paces of the Moat, and would undoubtedly have advanced farther, if they had had time. They approached upon that ſide of the City, not as being the weakeſt, for it was well flancked on both ſides, but with deſign (as I ſuppoſe) to get into the covered way, and by it to the <hi>Sowe</hi> or Dike next the Gate, which being broken down (for the earth was lower there) all the water of the Moat which it ſupported, would be let out, the Moats dreigned, and the Aſcent to the Walls, on all ſides by that means dry and eaſie. But the time, as we noted, failing them by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:104469:28"/>reaſon of the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> approach, King <hi>Charles</hi> betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelt to other Counſels, and making a ſhew as if he were not averſe from Peace, ſignified the ſame by a Trumpet to the City. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refuſed, as alſo the Propoſitions from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, for a Ceſſation from Arms rejected, as unſeaſonable, being they daily expected their relief; he omitted the preſent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking of <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> and transferred the War into the <hi>Sound,</hi> with a reſolution to oppoſe the <hi>Dutch</hi> in their paſſage that way with all his power.</p>
               <p>Whileſt theſe two parties do thus amuſe the world with their ſtruglings in <hi>Denmark,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet aſlembled at the <hi>Vly</hi> in <hi>North Helland.</hi> It is not imaginable with what fervor the depart of theſe ſuccours was preſſed by all men. <hi>De Witte</hi> Vice-Admiral of <hi>Rotterdam</hi> was firſt ready with his Squadron, and ſailed to <hi>Dogger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand,</hi> with Orders to expect the reſt of the Fleet there. But a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and dreadful Tempeſt riſing out of the North and North Eaſt, forced him back into the <hi>Maze,</hi> to repair the diſorders he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in it. But the Merchant-men did not eſcape ſo, for being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to reſiſt the rage and violence of the Sea, ſeveral of them were ſunk, and many being thrown upon the Coaſts of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Friezland,</hi> were ſplit and ſwallowed in that vaſt abyſs. Amongſt the reſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there was a Citizen of <hi>Dockum,</hi> whoſe misfortune ſeemed the moſt deplorable of any; the Ship he was in lay at Anchor, but he fearing it would not be able to ride out the ſtorm, preſſed the Maſter to cut the Cable, and truſt themſelves to the mercy of the Water, which the Skipper refuſing, added they had no hopes but in the firmneſs of their Anchor. The other not believing this, and ter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ſied by the prodigious reciprocation of the Waves, ran to the Cable with an Ax in his hand and cut it. The Ship being thus at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſlew in a trice to the Neighbouring ſhore, and being flung againſt the Pales thereof, by the force of the Wind and Sea, after ſome reiterated ſhocks broke in pieces. Before the Ship was wrackt the man had lift up his Wife upon one of the pales, but turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to help his ſon which ſtood by him, a ſudden Guſt had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him by throwing the Boy over-boord, which the Father ſeeing, catched with one hand at one of the Pales, whileſt he ſtoopt with the other to help his Child, which he had done, if the ſaid Pale being rotten and unable to ſupport his weight, had not broken, whereby he alſo fell. His Wife aſtoniſhed with ſo diſmal a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and ſeiſed with a ſudden grief, fell into a ſound, and as if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſurvive ſuch dear pledges, tumbled head-long into the Sea, and periſhed with her Husband and Child in that unpitying Element.</p>
               <p>There was no induſtry omitted to repair <hi>De Witte</hi>'s ſhattered Veſſels, as alſo to make ready the reſt of the Fleet, to which end the States ſent expreſs Commiſſioners to the <hi>Flye,</hi> who with their preſence and authority ſhould haſten theſe preparations. And now all things being in a readineſs, the Souldiers were embarked, only the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:104469:29"/>Wind was contrary, and by good fortune continued ſo, until the number of the Fleet was well-nigh doubled, for when they were firſt ordered to ſet ſail, they were ſcarce ſtrong twenty men of War. <hi>James Waſsenar</hi> Hier of <hi>Opdam,</hi>

The <hi>Swedes</hi> had uſed all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to hinder theſe preparations of the <hi>Dutch;</hi> they had offered the States their own conditions in the <hi>Sound,</hi> and had amply enough not only laid before them their old and inviolable Confederations, but alſo the ill uſage which they had received from the <hi>Danes,</hi> by their manifold exactions. But ſeeing the States reſolved, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved alſo, to carry it on with a high hand, in as much as in them lay, and venture a Battle, though at Sea, rather than be frighted or treated, out of their hopes and Conqueſts in <hi>Denmark.</hi> They therefore had their Katches and Spy-boats, ſwarming about the Coaſts of <hi>Holland,</hi> to obſerve the Fleets order and motion; not wanting as well friends as intelligence, within the very <hi>United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces</hi> themſelves. And that it might appear that theſe were real ones, two Shipps loaden with Ammunition, packed up in Herring Tuns, were intercepted in the <hi>Texel,</hi> deſigning to direct their courſe for <hi>Corſoer</hi> in <hi>Zeland.

He went daily upon the Sands to viſit and view their numbers, and bulk, and order, with his perſpectives. Sometimes he ſeemed reſolved to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Wind and Stream, and fall upon them where they were, which both himſelf and many of his great Officers, wiſhed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they had done; conſidering that if they had been worſted, they might have retreated to <hi>Gottenburg,</hi> and that both the ſhores were poſſeſſed by the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Troops. But the contrary opinion prevailed, which was to expect them in the <hi>Sound,</hi> being they muſt firſt paſs the batteries of the Caſtles from both ſides, and that they themſelves if they were not victorious, might abundantly ſecure their retreat, by the neighbourhood of theſe two Forts, and the Haven of <hi>Lanskrown.</hi> The Wind being come about, and blowing gently out of the North, <hi>Opdam</hi> ſummoned the chief Officers and Captains on board, and having given thoſe Orders to each of them which were neceſſary, diſmiſſed them with this admonition; that they ſhould not be wanting to themſelves, to their Country, nor to them whoſe deliverance depended upon the ſucceſs of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent endeavours.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:104469:30"/>carried in Fluyts, but manned and armed as the other with Cannon for war; except ſome few Companies and commanded men, which were diſperſed and mingled with the Sea-men, in the ſeveral Veſſels of the Fleet. Count <hi>Wrangel</hi> High-Admiral of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> who had hitherto lain with his Fleet, conſiſting of two and forty men of War, whereof twelve or thirteen were of vaſt great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, under <hi>Cronenburg,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Opdam</hi>'s order and motion, reſolved to meet him in his paſſing the Streights. He had divided his Navy into four Squadrons, the firſt being led by <hi>Henry Gerdſon</hi> a <hi>Dutch Zealander,</hi> who having ſerved long in the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Fleet, would not now quit it; <hi>Wrangel</hi> himſelf followed him with the ſecond, Vice-Admiral <hi>Bielkenſtern</hi> with the third, and the Rear was cloſed by <hi>Guſtavus Wrangel,</hi> a Kinſman of the Admirals. King <hi>Charles</hi> had le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied Sea-men about <hi>Lubeck</hi> and <hi>Wiſmar,</hi> and had many <hi>Engliſh</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with the reſt. Many alſo of his old and beſt Souldiers, both Foot and Horſe, were brought on board, he being reſolved to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit nothing that lay within the compaſs of his power, for promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his Conqueſts, at leaſt conſerving the glory of his Arms by Sea as well as by Land.</p>
               <p>Things being thus ordered on both ſides, they met, and fought with equal hopes and courage. The <hi>Dutch,</hi> born as it were in the Sea, and expert in that Element, diſdained to ſee the honour they had acquired by their skill in Navigation, diſputed by an unknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Enemy, whileſt the <hi>Swedes</hi> were tranſported with deſire to ſhew themſelves men at Sea, as well as they had done by Land, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being their King was a Spectator, and an exact obſerver as well of the brave, as more degenerous actions of his Souldiers. It was betwixt eight and nine in the morning, when the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet was advanced mid-way betwixt the two Caſtles. They from <hi>Cronenburg</hi> ſaluted them with a brace of Guns, being the <hi>Swedes</hi> Signal, but with looſe powder: but the <hi>Datch</hi> not anſwering, they let fly with ſharp from both Fortreſſes, but did no great harm, by reaſon of the diſtance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only one Bullet fell into <hi>Peter Floriz</hi> his Ship out of <hi>Elzenburg</hi> Caſtle, which ſlew three of his men. <hi>De Witte,</hi> who led the Avanguard, approaching the <hi>Schonen</hi> ſhore, let flye a Broad ſide at the Bridge which extends it ſelf into the Sea, ſo that they at the Battery there, fearing the like greeting from the other Veſſels, quitted their Guns and fled into the Town. The Vice-Admiral being paſt the Bridge, directed his Courſe fully upon <hi>Wrangel,</hi> who advanced towards him, and however ſhot at by the <hi>Swedes</hi> Ships of their firſt Squadron, did not anſwer them, nor <hi>Wrangel</hi> himſelf who gave him a broad ſide, till he was come near him. He then diſcharged a whole volley of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non at him, and being repayed in kind, returned him his thanks in the ſame coin. The firſt Squadrons being paſt, the main Battles began to approach, and now the two Admirals being within reach, <hi>Wrangel</hi> thunders upon his Adverſary, with his great and ſmall ſhot, <hi>Opdam</hi> did the ſame, but with more ſucceſs; for <hi>Wrangel</hi>'s Ship loſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:104469:31"/>her Rudder in the encounter, which neceſſitated her to retire out of the Battle, and go to Anchor under the Caſtle of <hi>Cronenburg.</hi> By this time the Fleets were mingled, and the fight grew hot on all ſides, eſpecially where the chief Officers were; for whileſt each en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſuccour his own, all were engaged, which rendred the Combat terrible, and the more, being the place they contended in was ſo narrow. The conteſt betwixt <hi>Bielkenſtern</hi> and <hi>De Witte</hi> was very hot, and might have been diſputed longer, if the <hi>Swede</hi> being helped by one of his own Ships, called the <hi>Wiſmar,</hi> had not attacked him in his front and ſide, neither did he overcome him, till he had ſlain him, and ſunk his Veſſel; which his unadviſed running upon the ground did much contribute to. <hi>Opdam</hi> having oppreſſed <hi>Wran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi> was ſhot at, at a diſtance, by all the Ships that approached him, but laid on board by two, the <hi>Morning-ſtar</hi> and the <hi>Pellican.</hi> Theſe lying on his Lar-board ſide, fought luſtily, and extreamly perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Defendants with hand Granadoes, which they threw amongſt them out of the Round-top of their Main-maſts. A third Veſſel lying a ſtern of him, battered him ſorely behind, and powred ſmall ſhot into his Cabbin, but there was no body there, for the Admiral though then extreamly tormented with the Gout, had cauſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be carried in a Chair, and placed before the door of the Hut or Captains Cabbin, on top of the upper Decks, that he might as well ſee, as be ſeen of all men, and give thoſe directions that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion required. He ſuſtained the violence of the Enemies at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks for ſome time ſingly and alone, but <hi>Van Nes</hi> one of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains coming to his aid, the two Ships that had laid him on Board were maſtered, the one being ſunk by the ſaid <hi>Van Nes,</hi> and the other taken by himſelf, and mann'd by his Lieutenant, but ſunk alſo afterwards upon miſtake, by one of his own men of War. <hi>Opdam</hi>'s Ship, had in the heat of the Fight faln foul of the Sands, as <hi>de Witte</hi>'s had unhappily done before, if he had not prevented it by chopping to an Anchor, which ſaved him; for the Ship tacking about, by that means ſhe cut and recovered the deep again. In the mean time ſhe was extreamly battered, her ſails were all torn, her rigging broken, and her ſides ſo pierced with Bullets, that ſhe had five foot water in Hold. But nothing ſeemed more dreadful, than an accidental fire which took in the Poop, which would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved fatal, if it had not been ſuddenly quenched. <hi>Opdam</hi> had more than half his men ſlain and wounded, and his brave Capt. <hi>Egbert Meus,</hi> had received ſome ſlight hurts, which rather heated than hindered him, to do all the functions of a worthy Commander. For all this the Admiral did not quit the fight, until left alone betwixt the two Fleets, ſo that he then followed his own towards <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>de Witte</hi>'s ſhip, called the <hi>Brederode</hi> (their Admiral in the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:104469:31"/>War) was loſt, having been ſtranded and ſunk, as we have already mentioned. The <hi>Swedes</hi> had indeed taken Captain <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>'s Ship, having ſlain him, and well nigh all his men, but they quitted it again, it being on fire, which threatned its ſudden ruine; but that being quenched by the remaining <hi>Dutch</hi> who were left in it, being but 14 in number, the Veſſel was brought by them to the reſt of the Fleet. The loſs on the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſide was greater; for three of their Ships were taken, and two, ſome ſay more ſunk. There periſhed two more of their Ships, in their retreat to <hi>Lanskrown,</hi> one being ſtranded and quitted by them near the Iſle of <hi>Ween,</hi> and the other, running upon its own Anchor, ſplit in the entry of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. The number of the ſlain and drowned on the <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſide is uncertain; as near as I can gather, they doubled that of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> though theſe affirm them to have been more, and the other ſcarce ſo many. It is conſtant that all on neither ſide did not their duties, but being the number of eithers Cowards was not very diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, the diſadvantage that way ſeems not unequal. But to leave theſe degenerous ſpirits to the ſhame and puniſhment that attends them, we will purſue our Relation.</p>
               <p>Towards Evening, the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Admiral <hi>Bielke,</hi> who by reaſon of the contrary Winds could not get up to the fight, joyned <hi>Opdam</hi> betwixt <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> and <hi>Ween,</hi> with ſix men of War. Hereupon it was reſolved to engage the Enemies again, but they having ſecured themſelves in <hi>Lanskrown,</hi> the deſign was changed into a <hi>Blockade,</hi> and being they could not enter the Haven without too great a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, to endeavour to deſtroy it by ſinking ſeveral old ſhips filled with ſand, ſtones, broken Cannon, and ſuch like Ballaſt, in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of it, and ſo render the Fleet within it uſeleſs, by obſtructing their paſſage out again. The <hi>Swedes</hi> were at firſt frightened with the greatneſs of theſe preparations, not thinking that impoſſible, which they ſaw undertaken, and purſued with ſo much eagerneſs. Seeing therefore they could not hinder what they ſo much feared by force, they would try what threatning could do, and ſent King <hi>Frederick</hi> word, that they would revenge the detriment which ſhould be done their Haven, with the deſtruction of the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark.</hi> But the <hi>Danes</hi> did not deſiſt for all theſe menaces, but returned anſwer, that the King would perſiſt in his deſign, if he thought it might prove prejudicial to his Enemies, not deſpairing, but to be able another day to revenge thoſe injuries, which their malice might create him in <hi>Denmark,</hi> by a juſt retaliation in <hi>Sweden</hi> it ſelf. But this, as alſo another deſign of the <hi>Danes,</hi> to ſurpriſe the Caſtle of <hi>Elzenburg</hi> about the ſame time, proved fruitleſs. Six hundred foot were ordered for this exploit, but being oppoſed by a rude ſtorm were forced back, though not without ſome loſs. The whole Fleet, the Winter being far advanced, was likewiſe obliged to return to <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> for the Sea began already to freeze, and cruſt with drifts of Ice.</p>
               <p>It is not imaginable, with what exceſs of joy the <hi>Dutch</hi> Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:104469:32"/>were received within the City, but the Beſieged were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported when they ſaw (the next morning after the fight) that the <hi>Swedes</hi> had quitted their Works and Approaches near the Town, and were retired. The Sun had no ſooner diſcovered the Enemies Retreat, but the forſaken Trenches ſwarmed with the glad Citizens; The Works which had been raiſed againſt them were levelled, and whatever the <hi>Swedes</hi> had left behind them of moment, carried in triumph into the Town. Theſe publick joys were further celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, with publick Thankſgiving in all the Churches, and this oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed people, ſeemed raiſed by this unexpected deliverance to hopes of a better fortune.</p>

               <p>In both the forecited Inſtructions, mention is made of a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Aſſiſtance, concerning which theſe three things are to be noted.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, Aſſiſtance was to be given the <hi>Swede</hi> conditionally, in caſe a Peace could not be obtained, and the repugnancy to the Peace, was on the part of the King of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:104469:37"/>2 It was to be given defenſively onely, againſt thoſe who ſhould aſſault the <hi>Swede.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3 The Treaty was to be ſigned and ratified by the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> previous to the Aſſiſtance, leſt after his work done, he might profit upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Aſſiſtance to their own diſadvantage. To which purpoſe, it is remarkable, that Sir <hi>Philip Meadow</hi> was authoriſed by the thirteenth Article of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, to uſe his endeavour, to procure ſome reaſonable ſecurity that the particulars contracted and agreed in the ſaid Treaty be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and obſerved. In purſuance whereof, he afterwards to taſt the temper of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Court, propounded that <hi>Stade</hi> upon the River <hi>Elbe,</hi> and <hi>Landſcrown</hi> a conſiderable Port within the <hi>Sound,</hi> ſhould be depoſited in <hi>Engliſh</hi> hands, as a pledge and Garanty of the faith of the Aſſiſted. But this Treaty of Aſſiſtance being the ſame in ſubſtance with that ſent upon the Fleet under General <hi>Mountague,</hi> in the Spring of the following year, I have reſerved it to that place.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The year was by this time run out,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jan.</hi> 3. 1658.</note> without any remarkable acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Denmark,</hi> but the new one produced new exploits, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the new Deſigns of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> though for the moſt part unfortunate: for their attempt upon <hi>Langland</hi> failed, and they were beaten off from <hi>Meun</hi> with loſs. The Iſland of <hi>Bornholm</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſurpriſed and ſuppreſſed the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Garriſon in it, retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the obedience of her old Lord, and when the waters were open, furniſhed the City with great ſtore of proviſions. The Cold had congealed and frozen the whole Sea, all ways were paſſable, and all paſſages open. The azur'd plain was marbled with Ice, the two groſſer Elements making but one vaſt Champion: and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this was the beſt ſeaſon to war in, in thoſe cold Regions, and the time wherein the <hi>Swedes</hi> had atchieved their greateſt Conqueſts. <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> was as well in their eye, as in their thoughts, and the only object they now aimed at. The acquiſition of this remaining City, would was well crown as compleat their Victories, beſides the addition of a Fleet as an Appendix to their triumphs. King <hi>Charles</hi> was therefore reſolved to omit nothing for the compaſſing of this great Deſign, and now four thouſand choiſe Souldiers were orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make an attempt upon the Enemy. Theſe were all diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by wearing their ſhirts upon their clothes, to render them leſs diſcernable in the Snow. They were armed each with a brace of Piſtols faſtened to their Girdles, being provided alſo with Spurs for their hands and knees, againſt the ſlipperineſs of the Ice. But their Deſign being diſcovered by one that fled from them into the Town, was laid aſide for the preſent. Neither were the <hi>Danes</hi> wholly idle, they had ſecret correſpondence with ſome Citizens of <hi>Malmuyen,</hi> and hopes to ſurpriſe that conſiderable Town. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion ſeemed fair, as it was ſuppoſed, and the ſouldiery (moſt whereof were <hi>Netherlanders</hi>) was imbarked for this important en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe But they loſt their way in the dark, being by the unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Pilots, ſtranded upon the ſhallows of <hi>Southolm,</hi> which
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:104469:37"/>lucked well, for the <hi>Swedes</hi> had notice of the whole tranſaction, and having re-inforced their Garriſon with 600 men, expected them with impatience. The <hi>Danes</hi> had ſent one <hi>Troll,</hi> a Gentleman of the Kings Chamber, who was the Author of this Expedition, to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Coaſts, but whether his intention was to ſurpriſe his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris or the Town is uncertain, both are credible in a Lover and a Souldier. However it was he brought a young Lady back with him, which he had found in an appointed place without the Town, and word that the buſineſs was diſcovered, and not to be purſued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eminent danger. In the mean time, two Traitors who had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to burn the Fleets were intercepted. They were induced thereto, by very extraordinary rewards, but being diſcovered re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived other payment, more ſuitable to their treaſon, and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate endeavours.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> being reſolved to vex the Citizens, drew out their Troops almoſt every night, frightning and wearying them with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Allarms. They hoped to find ſome opportunity or other to ſurpriſe them, grown negligent through cuſtom, or an opinion of their ſtrength: but they were deceived, for the <hi>Danes</hi> having their Centinels upon the Steeples and heights of the Town, were warned by their Cannon, and tolling of their Bells, of every ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance or motion of the Enemy, ſo that their Walls upon every the leaſt Allarm, were immediatly filled with the Defendants, who crowded from all parts to oppoſe the danger. King <hi>Charles</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeeing he could neither intercept nor ſurprize them, reſolved to attack them by force, and relying upon the valour of his uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Army, and his own good fortune, which had thus long been prodigal in her favours to him, would, notwithſtanding the ſtrength of the Fortifications, and the numerouſneſs of the Garriſon; try what he could do by a general Aſſault. He had many reaſons that preſt his very haſt. Amongſt others, he apprehended the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious made in <hi>Holland,</hi> where a great Fleet, and a freſh ſupply of Souldiers, expected only the Spring to ſet ſail: but that which perplexed him moſt, was, that it had been not obſcurely intimated to him, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (whom he truſted above all other) had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, they would not willingly ſee <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> change Maſter; ſo that fearing now his friends as well as his enemies, he would whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt he had time attempt it, ſuppoſing if he had carried it, it would be no impoſſible matter for him to make peace with the one, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile himſelf with the other.</p>
               <p>At this time Sir <hi>Philip Meadow</hi> being in the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Camp, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received Letters from <hi>England,</hi> inſtructing him to urge a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Treaty betwixt the two Crowns, ſent into <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> ſeveral Propoſals to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> conformable to his Orders, to preſs the buſineſs of a ſpeedy Peace, in order to prevent the hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous contingencies of an Aſſault, to which he ſaw all things diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and prepared. The Gentleman alſo whom he ſent, did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely intimate the ſaid preparations in the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Camp, for a
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:104469:38"/>general Attack, but the King nothing terrified here with, returned anſwer, That he could not in honour and ſafety, enter upon a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and ſeparate Treaty, without a comprehenſion and incluſion of the reſt of his Allies. The <hi>Swedes</hi> having notice of this refuſal, prepare to force that by Arms, which they could not get by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and approaching the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>own walls with their beſt Troops, fired a Prame or Flat-boat, which lay betwixt <hi>Chriſtians-haven</hi> and the City, armed with ſix ſmall Guns, and twelve Souldiers. But the day comming on, they retired for that time into their Camp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, without any further attempt. The Night following they made another ſhow of aſſaulting the Works, but retired as before, and for the ſame reaſon. The third day, the Army being well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed, was drawn out of the Camp, and being abundantly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with all things neceſſary for the preſent Expedition, was commanded to march. The King had affigned each Regiment his Poſt, and the place they ſhould attack, and having ordered that the Souldiers ſhould wear Straw, and little bundles of <hi>Juniper</hi> on their Arms or Caps, gave the word, <hi>God help us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſign to fall on being given by firing ſome pitcht Barrels, the King, who was preſent, commanded fifty Musketiers to go and take poſſeſſion of the Ravelin, before the half Bulwork near the Weſt Port. This being done, Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Geneki</hi> marched with two hundred men, on the right hand of the ſaid Ravelin, up to a little Work which lies betwixt the long Gallery and the Wall. <hi>Delwig</hi> attackt the half Bulwork with his Regiment, and Major General <hi>Ferſen</hi> ſeconded him on his right hand. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>Palſgraves</hi> Troops, aſſaulted the Bulworks next the Kings Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, Collonel <hi>Voyette</hi> ſeconded by <hi>Aſchenberg</hi> with three hundred Horſemen now on foot, the Brew-houſe; and Major <hi>Smith</hi> aſſiſted by <hi>Bidal</hi> a Lieutenant of the Kings Guards, a man of War and a Prame, which lay betwixt <hi>Chriſtians-haven</hi> and the Town. The reſt fell upon the other quarters of the City, as they were ordered, all full of hopes for a happy ſucceſs. But if the <hi>Swedes</hi> omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing for compaſſing of their Deſign, the <hi>Danes</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, whoſe mark was their Hankerchiefs in their Hats, were no leſs ſollicitous to divert the ſtorm, which did ſo threaten them. They were informed of the Enemies motion, by their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels, and Patrouillis without the Walls, ſo that they were more than ſufficiently allarmed and prepared to receive them. And truly we have not often heard of a more ſurious encounter. <hi>Charles</hi> ſhewing his men the riches and pillage of the Town, bids them hew out their own rewards, for all their paſt and preſent labours: whileſt <hi>Frederick</hi> riding from one Guard to another, tells his, that theirs and their Countries welfare, depended on their valour, and this moment of time. The fight grew high and hot; the Defendants upon firſt ſight of the Enemy, thundred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them with their great Guns as they approacht, but when they were come nearer, well-nigh over-whelmed them with ſhowrs of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:104469:38"/>Bullets, Cartrages, Wild-fires, Hand and Mortar-granadoes (which they rowled in great numbers from the Walls) and other offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive inſtruments. That ſide which the <hi>Swedes</hi> aſſaulted was beſt flancked of any, ſo that they were viewed and ſhot at from ſeveral parts at once: but they choſe it by reaſon of the Ice, to avoid the Graffs and Palliſadoes, and becauſe the Works there were leſs compleat than the other, the Sea in gentler ſeaſons rendring them inacceſſible on foot. For all this, they came up to the very Walls. <hi>Ferſen</hi>'s men were got ſo cloſe, that they were ſecure from the Flancks, and having pulled out ſome of the Palliſadoes, began to rear their Ladders, and mount. The Beſieged, on the other ſide, filling the Bulworks with their numbers, and their Moates with ſwarms of Darts, which they inceſſantly threw upon the Aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants, forced them back; three or four got upon the top of the Works, but being ill ſeconded periſhed there, though otherwiſe worthy a better fortune. Neither were the <hi>Swedes</hi> more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful elſe where: the Colonels <hi>Gengel</hi> and <hi>Voyet</hi> were ſlain; and <hi>Aſhenberg, Heſtrige,</hi> and <hi>Weyſſenſteyn</hi> being ſorely wounded, the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers they had led, began to give back. The King ſeeing it, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht Count <hi>Erick Steynbock</hi> with the <hi>Smaland</hi> Regiment, to their aſſiſtance, but he obſerving their diſorder, and apprehenſions at the loſs of their Officers, paſſed by them, with deſign to fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rampart next the Stables; but whileſt he endeavoured to paſs the Ditch, he was ſhot into the breaſt, and ſlain. Neither did the Lieutenant Colonel who commanded the <hi>Smalanders</hi> eſcape, he being alſo ſorely wounded, ſo that the Souldiers ſeeing their Leaders fall on all ſides, did not a little ſtagger. The King had alſo ſent the two <hi>Spars,</hi> with the other <hi>Swaland</hi> and <hi>Sudermanian</hi> Regiment to ſecond <hi>Ferſens</hi> men who fought ſo well; but ſeeing the inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the place they contended in, and the little appearance there was of ſucceſs, he commanded to draw off, though neceſſitated to retreat, through the tempeſt and inceſſant hail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the adverſe ſhot. The fight at the Ship was very hot, the <hi>Swedes</hi> had dragg'd Boats and Bridges with them to paſs the Water (for the Defendants had broken the Ice round about them) and ſome got over and entred, but being ill received by them on Board, and worſe ſeconded by their own men, they were forced out again, or ſlain in it. <hi>Smith</hi> and twelve more of his men were killed upon the Hatches, the Sea ſwallowed many, and ſuch as eſcaped the Cannon, were glad to ſave themſelves by a haſty ſlight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Banner</hi> and <hi>Vavaſor,</hi> who were ordered to keep the Enemy in allarm on the Eaſt-ſide, were no leſs unfortunate than their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades. <hi>Lentſman</hi> and <hi>Fittinghoff</hi> two Lieutenant Colonels, were commanded to aſſault the Cittadel, but they, whether upon mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake or a ſudden change in their deſign is uncertain, fell upon the Mill-bulwork next the Eaſt-Gate. The <hi>Netherland</hi> Auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, made up of ſeveral Companies, of thoſe Nations which are
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:104469:39"/>in ſervice of that Illuſtrious Republick guarded that Poſt, the which, together with the Port &amp; the neighbouring quarters, had been aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them upon, their firſt arrival; they had ſent 100 of their Souldiers with a drum of every Nation, at the beginning of the tumult to help the <hi>Danes</hi> where the ſtorm was hotteſt, which deceived the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, who believing by this various noiſe, that moſt of them were un to the danger, haſtened to take poſſeſſion of their for ſaken ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The night by this time was far ſpent, it being about four in the morning, and the ſtorm ceaſed on the other ſide, when it began with new courage and fury on this; for the <hi>Swedes</hi> having paſſed the <hi>Wartow</hi> Dike, marched with much confidence towards the <hi>Town</hi> Moat, and neglecting the Ravelin on their left hand, laid their Bridges, and crowding upon them endeavour to paſs; but theſe Bridges proved ſo ſhort, and conſequently unable to bear the weight they were preſſed with; ſo that the Aſſailants, terrified with this unexpected accident, retire again. Some indeed got over, but periſhed whileſt their Companions, who could not get to them, made what haſt they could to get away, leaving their Ladders, Bridges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> one hundred and ten common Souldiers, and their chief Officers, <hi>Vavaſor,</hi> and <hi>Fininghoff,</hi> and <hi>Lentſman,</hi> ſlain upon the place. The attempts that were made upon <hi>Chriſtians Haven</hi> and the North Gate, were ſcarce worth the mentioning, being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly feigned Alarms to frighten the Beſieged, leſt whileſt they ſeemed aſſaulted on all ſides. they might perceive on which it was ſeriouſly intended. Seeing therefore the conteſt ended where it was more really meant, they drew here alſo off, though not without ſome loſs, by reaſon of the inceſſant diſcharges of the adverſe Cannon, It would be unjuſt to paſs by the remarkable ſervice which the <hi>Dutch</hi> Seamen did in this ſtorm. <hi>Opdam</hi> kept a good troop of them near his perſon, for a reſerve upon all occaſions, but ſent his moſt expert Gunners to aſſiſt the <hi>Danes;</hi> theſe being numerous, and more skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than the other, diſcharged the Cannon with ſo much dexterity and ſpeed, that what with the multitude of Guns (there being three hundred and five upon the Walls, beſides ſeventy more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the four Prames, and two ſmall men of War) and their nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, the whole firing ſeemed but a continuall Volley. But the day began now to break, no leſs grateful to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, than diſmal to the Beſiegers. The Moats, the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcarps, and the whole Fields, covered with the bodies of dead and dying men, manifeſted the greatneſs of the ſlaughter. There lay ſlain upon the place, five hundred ſixty four dead bodies, beſides ſeveral which the Sea had ſwallowed up, and not a few who had been carried off by their friends.</p>
               <p>In the Catalogue which was given the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> by his command after the fight, there are found five hundred and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dead, and nine hundred wounded. Amongſt others was Count <hi>Erick Steynbock,</hi> General of the Ordnance, <hi>La Voyes</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Collonel (both which died of their wounds in the Camp.) Major
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:104469:39"/>General Sir <hi>William Vavaſor</hi> was found amongſt the dead, with his Ears cut off by the greedy Souldiers, to get his jewels that hung in them. <hi>Guengel, Dromond, Lentſman, Fittingboff,</hi> and <hi>Smith,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a great number of inferior Officers, at leaſt a hundred, fell in that bloudy aſſault. The Beſieged loſt ſcarce ten of theirs, and now the Enemy being gone, ruſh out of their Fortifications, and ſtripping both the dead and dying, ſent theſe later to bear their friends company: the <hi>Swedes</hi> had leſt ſix Colours behind them, twelve Drums, two Mortar-pieces, two Petards, and many ſcaling Ladders, Bridges and other inſtruments of War, all which were brought in triumph into the City, and the ſame morning <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung in all the Churches for the delivery of the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from ſo eminent a danger.</p>
               <p>Many who preſume to judge of the actions of Princes, and that by the event to, ſeemed to wonder why the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> did not at his firſt arrival before the Town, endeavour to take it by Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, being it was but weak in Fortifications, deſtitute of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and full of terrout and diſtractions? And why he did now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it at all, ſeeing the Citizens, having had time to recollect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, were grown ſtrong in the opinion of their numbers, and paſt ſucceſſes, that their Walls and Bulworks were high and firm, and their Gariſon re-inforced with great ſupplies of old Troops from their Confederates. It is conſtant that the King did not omit the Attacking of the City of his own accord, but by the perſwaſion of others, who affirmed, that it was an enterpriſe full of difficulty and raſhneſs, to provoke deſperate men, whoſe only hope was in their Arms. They further urged, that the City was not ſo weak in Fortifications, however thrown up in haſt, but that they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible. Nay this very thing was an invincible Argument, that they were ready and reſolved to ſuffer the worſt of extremities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they prepared for their defence with ſo much conſtancy and care. Moreover, they ſuppoſed it wholly incredible, that the King, the Nobles, the Clergy, and People, ſhould tamely ſurrender or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray his Crowns, their Honour, their Revenues, their Houſes, and Families, and all of them being they were numerous and armed, their Liberties, their Country, and what ever was more dear to them, to the common Enemy. It was ſafer therefore to draw out the War in length, being they themſelves were not very ſtrong. Laſtly, the multitude was to be overcome by delays, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of the mind, however they may be of proof againſt ſudden violence, yet they are oft found to languiſh in length of time, and by a continued ſucceſſion of injuries. Theſe and the like were the reaſons of thoſe, who were againſt the preſent aſſaulting of the Town, and they prevailed then; but ſeeing it fell out otherwiſe, the King calling to mind the taking of <hi>Fredericks-Ode</hi> laſt year, where the Defendants out-numbred the Beſiegers, and conſidering that thoſe things which are moſt difficult, are moſt glorious, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:104469:40"/>nothing able to reſiſt the valour of his victorious Army, now great and formidable, reſolved to try his fortune which he had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto found ſo propitious and favourable. But his main encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were, the immenſe rewards of ſo noble a Conqueſt, the Monarchy of the North, and the Dominion of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea; which he had already ſwallowed up in his vaſt thoughts. On the other ſide, if the ſucceſs did not anſwer his expectation, the loſs would not be very great, bearing no proportion with the hopes of ſo many, and ſo great Victories, crowded up in the taking of one Town. However it was, his forces were beaten off, and forced to retire to their Camp, where we will leave them to mourn their preſent loſs, and bury their ſlain (which they ſerched off by leave from King <hi>Frederick,</hi> and inhumed with as much military pomp as the place and time would admit off) to proſecute thoſe other tranſactions of War, and Treaties, which were carried on in order to the relieving of this important City.</p>

Upon this account they conclude a League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt themſelves, and reſolve with their United ſtrength, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the ſuccouring of King <hi>Frederick</hi> by Land, as the <hi>Dutch</hi> did by water. The <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> commanded by <hi>Montecuculi</hi> were eſteemed eleven thouſand; <hi>Czerneski</hi> and his <hi>Poles</hi> ſix thouſand, all
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:104469:41"/>Horſe, and the <hi>Brandenburgers,</hi> at leaſt twelve thouſand ſtrong. The Elector himſelf, a warlike Prince, and heightened with the glory his valour had gained him in the famous Battle of <hi>Warſow,</hi> was General of this vaſt Army:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 17. 1658.</note> And now their divided Forces being met, they reſolve to march into <hi>Holſtein,</hi> where the <hi>Swedes</hi> had hitherto lorded without reſiſtance. Being advanced as far as the Borders, the Elector commanded publick Proclamation to be made; How that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> having ſignified to the Emperor and himſelf, in what manner the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had broken the Peace made in <hi>February</hi> laſt, invaded <hi>Denmark</hi> without any denunciation of War; beſieged <hi>Cronenburg</hi> and <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> and deſigned the Conqueſt of the whole Kingdom: had alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to joyn his forces with the Emperours, and come with all poſſible ſpeed to his relief. He therefore declared, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the juſt demands of a Prince he was in League with, he was haſtening to his aſſiſtance, to deliver him rom his oppreſſors, and procure a firm and equitable Peace. Laſtly, he deſired all men to contribute their endeavours to ſo juſt a work, eſpecially in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualling his Army, promiſing in caſe they did, to protect the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants from all violence and diſorder of the Souldiery.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Swedes</hi> unable to reſiſt ſo powerful an Enemy, thought it ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to withdraw betimes; but leſt they might not prejudice their Adverſaries in their very retreat, they deſtroyed all the forrage they met with, burnt all the Villages and Houſes in their way, and rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned what ever they thought might be of uſe to their purſuers. Having paſt the River <hi>Egder,</hi> on a Bridge of Boats, they broke it after them, and retiring into <hi>Jutland</hi> with their General the Prince of <hi>Sulsbach,</hi> encamped their wearied forces at <hi>Fredericks-ode</hi> a Sea Town of the leſſer <hi>Belt,</hi> and well fortified with Bulwork, and a ſtrong Gariſon. The Elector followed the ſad track of this flying Enemy,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 25.</note> and being come to <hi>Gottorp,</hi> the Dukes Reſidence, commanded a Battery to be raiſed againſt the Caſtle, threatning its ruine in caſe of reſiſtance. The Duke of <hi>Holſtein</hi> who had retired betimes to <hi>Tonningen,</hi> a ſtrong Fortreſs lying on the North Sea, having notice of this ſummons, ſends an Envoy to the Prince Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor to deſire a Neutrality, which was granted him upon condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he ſhould deliver his Caſtle to the Confederates, as a gage of his future good behaviour, and pay ſixty thouſand Ryx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dollers as a preſent ranſom. <hi>Gottorp</hi> being ſurrendred, the Army marched to <hi>Alſen,</hi> a little Iſland ſeparated from the Continent, by a ſmall Arm of the Sea, which they paſſed in Boats under favour of their Cannon, and over-powring the Enemy in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, forced them to retire. Collonel <hi>Aſchenberg</hi> commanded in the Iſland, with three Regiments of Horſe and ſome few Foot, but being ſhut up in <hi>Sunderburg,</hi> and ſeeing no hopes of relief, he ſilently conveyed himſelf and his Souldiers, by favour of the night, into ſome Ships that arrived there ſome hours before, and ſo eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the danger. The following day diſcovered the Enemies flight;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:104469:41"/>but all then baggage, fifteen hundred Horſes, and twenty four pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Canon, fell into the Conquerours hands; who in purſuit of their Victory marched immediately to <hi>Nordburg,</hi> another Fort in the Iſland, which they likewiſe took without reſiſtance, and in it Collonel <hi>Knuſt</hi> with his Regiment, who were forced to deliver up themſelves and the place to the power of the Confederates.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dec.</hi> 15.</note> The Iſland being thus cleered <hi>Czerneski</hi> marched towards <hi>Jutland,</hi> and falling upon a party of the <hi>Swedes</hi> at <hi>Colding,</hi> beat them, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Kings Pallace, put the whole Gariſon to the ſword, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving only the Governour and his Lieutenant, to publiſh his victory and their own misfortune. The Confederate Army drawing near <hi>Fredericks-Ode,</hi> met with a party of two hundred and fifty <hi>Swedes</hi> Horſe, who had been ſent to diſcover their Forces. Theſe falling unwarily upon the Prince of <hi>Anhalts</hi> Troops, were beaten and rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, many of them ſlain, and Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Strekihurſt</hi> that commanded them, with ſome other Officers of note, taken priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. The Prince heightened with this ſucceſs, draws near the Town, but finding the Gariſon ſtrong and reſolved, contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the advantage he had already got. The Winter was too much advanced, and the Weather too wet, to undertake a Siege ſo full of difficulty as this was like to prove. The Army was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent into Winter quarters, and divided by Regiments into the ſeveral Provinces of <hi>Holſteyn</hi> and <hi>Jutland,</hi> in expectation of a milder ſeaſon. The Winter being paſt, both parties prepare a freſh for War; the <hi>Swedes</hi> had ſuffered much within the Town, and loſt many of their men, poyſoned with ſtenches, and other calamities.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nov</hi> 165</note> Marſhal <hi>Wrangel</hi> had taken this place by Aſſault, the year before, and the dead bodies having been thrown by heaps into holes, and but ill covered, broke out again, inſomuch, that the ſtreets ran with the gore and matter, which iſſued from thoſe diſ-interred carkaſſes. This ſo infected the Air, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> reſolved to quit the place; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, the greatneſs of the Works, containing ſeven capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bulworks, required more men for their defence than they could well ſpare. Having therefore demoliſhed the Fortifications, and burnt the Town, they tranſported their Troops over into <hi>Funen,</hi> leaving only a Garriſon in the Cittadel, which was preſently beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Confederates, and indeed taken, but empty; for the <hi>Swedes,</hi> unable to reſiſt the Enemies violence, ſtole away by night, with moſt of their Cannon and Proviſions, over into <hi>Funen.</hi> They left ſome iron Guns behind them but nailed up, and having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed what the former flames had ſpared, mined their own Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, and filling the Cavities with Powder, laid a train which might give it fire. The next morning the Confederates ſeeing the Enemy gone, ruſh careleſly into the Caſtle, and unmindful of what might happen, were moſt of them that had entred, by the ſudden taking of the Mines, blown up and buried in the ruines of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed Conqueſt. The Confederates having forced the <hi>Swedes</hi> out of the Continent, reſolved to purſue them into their very retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

                     <hi>Jun.</hi> 1.</note> Hereupon they attack the ſmall Iſle of <hi>Fenoe,</hi> ſeated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Jutland</hi> and <hi>Funen.</hi> The fight was ſharp, until the <hi>Swedes</hi> were forced to flye and ſave themſelves in <hi>Funen,</hi> having left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them one Colonel, three Captains, ſeveral other leſſer Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſix Field-pieces, and one hundred common ſouldiers. The Confederates did not looſe above forty men in this exploit, and being now Maſters of the Iſland, filled it with men and Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a place very convenient for the invading of <hi>Funen.</hi> Having therefore all things in a readineſs, and filled all their Sloops and Boats with Souldiers, they made for <hi>Funen,</hi> under favour of ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> men of War, which lay there to facilitate their paſſage. They deſigned to aſſault the Iſland in four ſeveral places at once, which they endeavoured, but being ill received by the Defendants, could not reach the Shore. The <hi>Swedes</hi> had fortified all the Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues and deſcents with Trenches, Traverſes, and Cannon in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. Their Forces were likewiſe great and ſtrong, eſpecially in Horſe, ſeveral ſupplies being come out of <hi>Zeland</hi> to their ayd, ſo that the enterpriſe ſeemed no leſs difficult than great, to undertake to force an Enemy, ſo well intrenched and ſo numerous as they were. The Confederates loſt above three hundred, in their retreat, beſides the ſlain and drowned in the Attack, which were many. On the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſide there fell about two hundred, which number had been undoubtedly greater, if they had fought in a more equal place.</p>
               <p>This misfortune did not ſo diſhearten the Confederates, but they reſolved to adventure another attempt, only the place ſeemed not ſo proper, as it was at firſt imagined. They therefore ſhip their men again, and make for <hi>Middleſfare</hi> where the Traject was narroweſt. The men of War got thither, for all the Enemies great and ſmall ſhot, but the Carriage-boats could not advance as was deſired, for the Wind turning, and the Stream which follows it being againſt them, they were forced to deſiſt, and turn back to <hi>Fredericks-Ode.</hi> The <hi>Swedes</hi> however glad of the Enemies retreat, thought nothing done, unleſs they could diſinable them from attempting to paſs the Streights for the future. This could not be effected, but by ruining their Boats and Veſſels, which they bravely endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but finding the Enemy more watchful than they had hoped, they were after a rude reception, forced back; two of their Boats being ſunk, with their men in them, by the Enemies Cannon. The Confederates ſeeing they get over in parties,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Jul.</hi> 4.</note> reſolve to attempt it with all their forces, and that in three ſeveral places, with their three Armies at once; but wanting Veſſels to tranſport ſo great a multitude, they ſent five of their ſix men of War, to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up all the Boats they could find alongſt the Coaſts of <hi>Jut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> having notice of the Confederates deſign, was ſolicitous how to prevent it. He therefore commanded Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Cox</hi> an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> then in his ſervice, with eight men of War,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:104469:42"/>one Catch, and one Fire-ſhip, to <hi>Middlefare</hi> to oppoſe them. He He met the five above-mentioned Ships at <hi>Ebeltot,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>July</hi> 23.</note> who were ſo affrighted with the ſight of this unexpected Enemy, that they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly cut their Cables, but ſeeing no way to eſcape, and having leſs mind to reſiſt, moſt of the Officers and Mariners ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on Shore with their Cock-boats. The Admiral indeed made a ſhew of Defence, but being ſorely wounded was forced to yield. The number of the ſlain was not great, but the priſoners many, eſpecially Souldiers; amongſt which there were ſix hundred <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgers;</hi> and four hundred <hi>Imperialiſts. Cox</hi> having maſtered the greater Veſſels, burnt thirty leſſer ones, commonly called <hi>Schuyts,</hi> that lay in the Haven. He went thence to <hi>Arhauſen,</hi> where having fired three Merchant-men, and one and twenty of the aforeſaid Schuyts, he threw his fire-brands into the Town it ſelf, notwithſtanding a thouſand <hi>Poles</hi> who were enquartered there. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving performed this great ſervice, he returned with his Fleet to the <hi>Sound</hi> in triumph. The conquered Ships followed ſpoiled of all their Ornaments, two whereof being <hi>Daniſh,</hi> having their Colours dragg'd at their Sterns, and the other two <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> equal with them in fortune, though not in diſgrace; which it may be was omitted in complement to the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadours, who ſtood in their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes at <hi>Elzeneur</hi> to behold the ſpectacle. This Victory, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever eaſily obtained, was a very great one, and highly eſteemed by King <hi>Charles</hi> himſelf, being now ſecure of <hi>Funen,</hi> the Enemies Veſſels, together with their hopes of paſſing thither, being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed. <hi>Cox</hi> was ennobled, and vaſtly rewarded for this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, the King being no leſs juſt in recompenſing merit, than in diſcountenancing baſeneſs, and no leſs prodigal in his favours, than ſevere in his puniſhments; knowing well that theſe are the true ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers up, to great and brave Atchievments.</p>
               <p>The Prince Elector moved with the loſs of his Ships, and having no other in a readineſs, nor no hopes of any from the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets, which the reiterated Ceſſations had rendred uſeleſs, laid aſide all thoughts of further attempting upon <hi>Funen.</hi> He thefore quitted <hi>Fenoe,</hi> and having ſunk his remaining Boats at <hi>Fredericks-Ode,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved his Camp to <hi>Hopdorp,</hi> on the South of <hi>Jutland,</hi> with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to transfer the War into <hi>Pomerania.</hi> The <hi>Swedes</hi> ſeeing the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy gone, re-garriſon <hi>Fenoe,</hi> and landing on the Continent, began to rebuild a Fort, which the <hi>Poles</hi> had demoliſhed upon the quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it: but having intelligence that a ſtrong party of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, which was left behind to hinder their incurſions, was marching towards them, they left their Works and retired into their Iſlands again.</p>
               <p>And this is the ſum of the Confederates Expedition, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures in <hi>Holſtein</hi> and <hi>Jutland,</hi> which I thought good for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods ſake to put thus together, leaving the more particular rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affairs, to them that will write their ſtory, for being my intention was only to obſerve what happened in order to this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:104469:43"/>Siege, and not the whole War, it will ſuffice to have only mentioned thoſe things which happened further off, though rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it.</p>
               <p>To return therefore to <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> where nothing of moment did happen after the great Storm: We find the Citizens ſecure within their Walls, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> in their Camp; whoſe Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and ſtrength in Horſe, took away all hopes the Enemy might conceive of attempting upon them. Both parties ſuffered much through the extremity of Winter, but the <hi>Danes.</hi> moſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut up from all communication from abroad, the Enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieging them by Land, and the Ice by Sea. But they bore theſe as they had done their former hardſhips, with great courage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. The approaching <hi>Spring</hi> encreaſed the hopes and fears on both ſides. The <hi>Danes</hi> expected more ſolid ſuccours from the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and the <hi>Swedes</hi> bragg'd of their more forward friends the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and indeed neither of them was deceived: In the mean time, both Kings prepare for War. The <hi>Dane</hi> makes ready his Fleet with all imaginable induſtry, whileſt the <hi>Swede</hi> reſolves the conqueſt of the remaining Iſlands. To this end, General <hi>Wrangel</hi> ſhips ſix hundred Foot, and three Regiments of Horſe, at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg</hi> in <hi>Funen,</hi> and ſets ſail for <hi>Langland,</hi> as the moſt acceſſible of them. Count <hi>Waldeck</hi> had attempted and taken it before, it being aſſigned him by the King for his Winter quarters: but he had been beaten out of it again with loſs, he himſelf having been likewiſe hurt in the arm. But <hi>Wrangel</hi>'s fortune was better, though his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory more difficult.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>March</hi> 19. 1659.</note> He came with his Fleet to <hi>Langland</hi> Head, where he deſigned to land, but the calm retarding his endeavours, gave the <hi>Danes</hi> time to haſten thither from all parts of the Iſland, ſo that they did not only repel the Enemy, but took one of their Long-boats with fifty men in it; this diſaſter did not at all diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the <hi>Swedes.</hi> They reſolve to venture again, but the place was not good to land in, being Mooriſh. They therefore ſent all their paſſage Boats, and moſt of their Souldiers by night, it being dark, to ſearch out a more convenient deſcent. In the mean time, the Fleet continued its ſtation, and ſending out their Cock-boats. kept the Enemy in perpetual Allarms, making ſhew of landing, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to conceal their intended deſign, which lucked ſo well, that the party they had ſent out, gained the ſhore three miles off, before the <hi>Danes</hi> had notice of it, and having immediatly caſt up a Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work to ſecure their entry, landed all their men without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable oppoſition: for thoſe that haſtened to the danger came too late, and in ſuch diſorder, that they were eaſily broken and routed. The remaining <hi>Danes</hi> retired into <hi>Traneker</hi> Caſtle, one of the Kings Houſes, which was ſurrendred at mercy, as likewiſe the whole I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland, without further reſiſtance. The Priſoners were many, at leaſt three hundred Souldiers, and above a thouſand Country fellows which were in Arms for defence of their Country, but forced to yield to the ſtrongeſt; the ordinary fate of Iſlanders, when a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:104469:43"/>Enemy is ſuffered to land. <hi>Langland</hi> being thus maſtered, <hi>Wrangel</hi> ſets ſail for <hi>Alſen,</hi> where landing his men, he took the Caſtle of <hi>Norburg</hi> by ſtorm, but having aſſaulted <hi>Sunderburg</hi> thrice in vain, quitted the Iſland again, and content with his former Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, and pillaging the Coaſts of <hi>Holſtein</hi> in his way, returned with his Priſoners and Prey to <hi>Funen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The loſs of <hi>Langland</hi> did much trouble the <hi>Danes,</hi> and oblige them to haſten out their Fleet with all poſſible ſpeed.

Being paſt the Iſland of <hi>Falſter,</hi> they diſcovered not far from <hi>Femeren,</hi> ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen <hi>Swediſh</hi> men of War, who having left <hi>Held</hi> to his liberty, thought to ſave themſelves through the <hi>Belt,</hi> but the Wind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving contrary, they were forced to prepare for fight.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>April</hi> 28.</note> The odds was indeed great, the <hi>Daniſh-Dutch</hi> being much ſtronger, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of an abſolute Victory, if they had not let it eſcape out of their hands by over-much precaution and circumſpection. <hi>Bielke</hi> as the Kings Admiral led the Van, and bearing up with the Enemy with a flown Sheet, came to a Tack, for fear that leſt advancing too much, he might looſe that Wind which he had ſo favourable, and which filled the Enemies eys with the ſmoak of his Cannon. He kept therefore to Windward, plying them with broad ſides as he paſt. <hi>Opdam</hi> following in the wake of the <hi>Danes</hi> did the ſame, not abſurdly fancying that when they had tired the Enemy, their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (provided they had had the Wind incloſed in Bottles) would be no leſs aſſured than eaſie. But it fell out otherwiſe, for during this Gun-fight, the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Admirals Main top-ſail came by the Board, which rendred his Ships motion leſs active, ſo that his men for fear of falling into the Enemies hands, called to <hi>Opdam</hi> to ſave them, which he did: but before they had brought a new Sail to the Yard, the Wind grew more favourable for the <hi>Swedes,</hi> for it turned from Eaſt North Eaſt, to South Eaſt; by which means and by the ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Gale, they having gained the Weather-gage, retired without any conſiderable loſs, to <hi>Wiſmar.</hi> The diſadvantage in this Naval skirmiſh was not great on either ſide. <hi>Bielkenſtern</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the <hi>Swedes</hi> was lightly hurt, and but very few of his men ſlain, which he had revenged with the conqueſt of the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>

               <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> ſeeing no way of conquering <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> but by the Conqueſt of the remaining Iſles, for they were the Granaries and Store-houſes of the City, reſolved to attempt them. To this end, he embarks himſelf in perſon, and being come with four men of War betwixt <hi>Warberg</hi> and <hi>Nypcopping,</hi> two Towns of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Falſter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>April,</hi> 20.</note> made ſhew of attacking a Fort raiſed by the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants for the defence of the latter. In the mean time, he ſent out a Long-boat with ſome of his Guards, under the Command of a Lieutenant Colonel, to coaſt and view the Shore; for the entry near the aforeſaid Fort was too difficult, by reaſon of the ſhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Water thereabouts. The Lieutenant Colonel fell ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally upon a Boat paſſing from <hi>Laland</hi> to <hi>Falſter,</hi> which he took, and in it the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Admiral <hi>Lindenowe,</hi> and ſeveral Letters deſigned for <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> containing the true ſtate of the Militia of the two Iſlands. The Prize being brought to the King, he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtricter examination commanded the Fort to be battered, but ſeeing it was but to little purpoſe; by reaſon of the diſtance and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty to land, he removed to <hi>Coldberg,</hi> where the Streight is nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roweſt and deep; ſo that bringing his Ships near the Shore, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the numerous Defendants, by his continual thundring of great and ſmall ſhot upon them, to quit their ſtation, and make place for his men to land, which they quickly did. The Country men threw down their Arms, and hid themſelves in the Wood, whileſt the Souldiery being cloſer purſued, was overtaken at <hi>Nycopping,</hi> and three hundred of them, who could not get ſoon enough over the paſſage, forced to ſubmit to the Enemies mercy. <hi>Falſter</hi> being thus ſubdued, the King in purſuit of his Victory, reſolves to Attack <hi>Laland,</hi> the fruitfulleſt of all the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Iſlands. He therefor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to <hi>Coldberg</hi> again, with ſix men of War, and ſeveral Carriage Boats, and coming up cloſe to the ſhore, for it is very deep there, began to play upon the Enemies Works. The noiſe of the Cannon brought the Iſlanders together, to the number of near five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, but all could not hinder the <hi>Swedes</hi> to land under favour of their Guns. They alſo maſtered the aforeſaid Works, which were open to the Land ſide, which ſo terrified the Enemy, that they were at a ſtand what to do, until the King cauſed Proclamation to be made by ſound of Trumpet, that the Inhabitants ſhould retire to their ſeveral dwellings, for he would uſe no hoſtility, but againſt ſuch as were found in Arms. Hereupon they all retired, and left a free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage for the <hi>Swedes</hi> to land with all their forces. Only <hi>Naskow</hi> did dare to put a ſtop to the Enemies Cariere and Victories: For the Town being well fortified, and filled with the Souldiers that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired thither out of <hi>Falſter,</hi> and all the parts of the Iſland; and furniſhed with an immenſe quantity of Corn and other Proviſions, ſeemed able enough to hold out a very long Siege; and truly it coſt the Enemy much pains and time, as will hereafter appear, before they could take it. The King having thus maſtered theſe Iſlands,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104469:44"/>found Corn enough in them to ſuffice a great Army for a year. He therefore ſent two thouſand Tuns of Rye, and one thouſand of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley into <hi>Funen,</hi> where the want was greateſt, and victualled his Fleet for ſix Moneths beſides.</p>
               <p>Whileſt the King was thus ordering his affairs in <hi>Laland,</hi> another part of his Forces were employed in the conqueſt of <hi>Meun,</hi> where the reſiſtance was greater, than in any of the greater Iſlands. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor <hi>Schroder</hi> commanded there, aſſiſted with a hundred Horſe, and five hundred armed Boors. The <hi>Swedes</hi> were at firſt bravely beaten off, and obliged,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apr.</hi> 26.</note> by reaſon of the ſhallowneſs which hindered their Ships to approach the Shore, to quit their deſign for the preſent. In the mean time, the Garriſon was ſtrengthened by the addition of a Company of Foot from <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> which apprehended the danger moſt, this Iſland lying neareſt to it, and readieſt to aſſiſt it. But the Enemy, watchful upon all occaſions, had cauſed new fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned Carriage-boats to be made at <hi>Nycopping</hi> in <hi>Falster,</hi> each of theſe held fifty Horſe in their Hull or Bottome, and as many Foot upon the Decks, which were environed with thick plancks, made Breaſt-work wiſe, and Musket proof. Theſe Veſſels were ſo flat, that lying level with the ſhore, the Horſemen mounted might eaſily get out; whileſt the Foot facilitated their paſſage if there were need, with their ſhot from above as out of a Fortreſs. Theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle-boats, being ready and filled with Souldiers put off, and making towards the ordinary Landing-place, drew all the Enemies forces thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to oppoſe them, which they obſerving, ſuddenly changed their Courſe, and directing it to an unuſual quarter, rowed with that vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that they ruſhed on ſhore, and landed all their men, maugre the feeble reſiſtance of the Defendants, who were indeed but few. There was an Inlet of the Sea betwixt that place which the Iſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders guarded, and that other where the Enemy landed, ſo that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Governour could get thither to oppoſe their deſcent, they were got into Battalia, and yet he charged them bravely, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounded himſelf, and ſeventy of his men ſlain upon the place, he was forced to yield the Victory, and the price of it the Iſland, to his more numerous Enemies. And thus all the Iſlands fell into the <hi>Swedes</hi> hands, and all the Kingdom likewiſe, except <hi>Coppenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> ſhrewdly ſhaken with the loſs of its obeying Provinces. The City was likewiſe blockt up on all ſides, the Camp keeping them from any Communication by Land, and four, ſometimes five of the Enemies Ships beſieging their Haven by Sea, ſo that nothing mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial could enter in or out, without the Adverſaries leave. This cauſed a great dearth within, which laſted all the Summer, and might have continued longer to the ruine of that Noble Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if they had not been relieved by the coming of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet.</p>
               <p>General <hi>Wrangel</hi> had hitherto held the City of <hi>Naskow</hi> cloſe beſieged, and having taken the Iſlet before the Town, and the two Forts in it, which ſecured the paſſage by water, ſtraightened
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:104469:45"/>it ſo, that the ſuccours deſigned for the relief of the beſieged, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever aſſiſted by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>May</hi> 23.</note> could not enter. <hi>Wrangel</hi> hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſummons the place, adding threats to his invitations, which the Garriſon rejected, with no leſs courage than conſtancy. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal General was loth to leave the Work he had ſo well begun unfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, but being called to a more weighty employment, he was forced to quit it, and haſten to the defence of <hi>Funen,</hi> ſo much me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced, and ſo often attempted by the Confederates, as hath been already related. The Garriſon was glad to be rid of this valiant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, but their joy did not laſt long, for Field Marſhal <hi>Steynbock</hi> being ſent to ſucceed him, and not ignorant in whoſe place he came, was heightened with the example. He therefore preſſed the Beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with all his induſtry; and having got all things neceſſary for forcing of the place, approached, battered, and mined it, with that vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, that the Garriſon unable to reſiſt any longer, was conſtrained to ſurrender.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>July</hi> 26.</note> Thus this conſiderable place wanting powder, and hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of relief, fell into the Enemies hands, who proud with ſo ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal a Victory, ſent moſt of their Troops to proſecute the Siege of <hi>Coppenhagen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus we have hitherto continued our obſervations of what happened at Land. Neither did the Sea want its conteſts, though leſs bloudy, whileſt thoſe two Potent Commonwealths, of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> made preparations equal to their Grandeur, for the carrying on of their ſeveral intereſts, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of aſſiſting their Allies. The truth is, the Trade of the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> and free paſſage of the <hi>Sound,</hi> excluſive each to other, was the ground of their jealouſie, and the deſign of their Arms. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts between the <hi>Swede</hi> and <hi>Dane</hi> (remaining as it were) in <hi>aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librio,</hi> it was generally believed, that which Stateſoever could firſt ſend from home a conſiderable Fleet, would carry the buſineſs, and compoſe the buſineſs of the <hi>Sound</hi> to their own mind. Yet it is worth the noting, in this main end of theirs, what great advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the <hi>Dutch</hi> had over the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> for by aſſiſting their Ally the <hi>Dane,</hi> if they prevailed, and ruined the <hi>Swede,</hi> they looked for no leſs than an abſolute Guardianſhip as it were of the Crown, both by their Land and Sea forces, and in conſideration of their lent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys; to have been their own ſecurity for paſſing the <hi>Sound,</hi> and impoſing a reſtriction upon any elſe at pleaſure, and ſo engroſs the Navigation and Commerce of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea to themſelves: Whereas <hi>England</hi> by aſſiſting their Ally the <hi>Swede,</hi> and helping him to conquer <hi>Denmark,</hi> could not aſſure to themſelves the benefit they looked for, but muſt remain precarious, and ſtand to the courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of a potent Monarch, whileſt they had but his bare faith pligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to give them equal priviledges with <hi>Swedes,</hi> to paſs the <hi>Sound</hi> Toll-free, and to have their Enemies excluded the Trade of the <hi>Baltick.</hi> Both States therefore prepare their Fleets, each of forty men of War. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> (as is already mentioned) had about the latter end of the laſt year, ſent a Fleet towards <hi>Denmark,</hi> but that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:104469:45"/>being by reaſon of Tempeſts, and the unpaſſableneſs of the Seas, full of ſholes of Ice, unable to advance, was obliged to return. The Winter being paſt, General <hi>Montague</hi> was ſent thither with a ſecond, no leſs uſeful for ſervice, being very well fitted for War, and well manned, with betwixt nine or ten thouſand men (but no Land forces) then glorious for oſtentation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet was got ready with that expedition, that it put to Sea a Fortnight or three Weeks before the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which bred no little jealouſie in them, ſeeing their Rivals ready before them, and that with ſuch powerful Forces; however Mr. <hi>Downing</hi> then Reſident at the <hi>Hague</hi> had aſſured them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apr.</hi> 6.</note> that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet which was gone towards the <hi>Sound,</hi> had no Orders to uſe any kind of hoſtility againſt their Shipping, but only to endeavour the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a Pacification betwixt the two Crowns. And it proved ſo, though the States were hardly induced to believe it; And yet they will not now (making a vertue of neceſſity) ſeem to wiſh it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſo that their preparations moved flower, at leaſt in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; whileſt they gave out, that they did not need to make haſt, being <hi>Denmark</hi> was ſecured in the Neutrality of that preſent pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. General <hi>Montague</hi> having Rendevouzed in <hi>Sould Bay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>March</hi> 27. 1659.</note> weighed the twenty ſeventh of <hi>March,</hi> and arrived in the <hi>Sound</hi> at an Anchor between the Iſland of <hi>Ween</hi> and <hi>Cronenburg</hi> Caſtle <hi>April</hi> 6.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apr.</hi> 6.</note> And And by agreement between the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, neither flag was ſtirred, but born aloft, and the three Flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips as they paſſed by the Caſtle, ſaluted it (where the King and Queen were in perſon) with 21, 19, and 17 Guns. Every other Ship gave only a Volley of ſmall ſhot, which were anſwered (Flags and all) only with two Guns, each according to the Cuſtom of <hi>Sweden.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Inſtructions given to General <hi>Montague,</hi> I have thought proper to inſert here, being they will give great light to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paſſages of that Summers action.</p>
               <p>WHereas upon conſideration had of the ſtate of Affairs in the Eaſtern parts, and particularly of the War faln out betwixt the two Kings of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark;</hi> which hath greatly diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the Navigation, and Commerce of this and other Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing States, and diſtracted the Affairs of the greateſt part of <hi>Europe,</hi> We thought it neceſſary to uſe Our beſt endevours, for compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the ſaid War, and thereby to remove the manifold Evils, and Inconveniences which depend thereupon; And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, gave directions to Sir <hi>Philip Meadow</hi> Our Envoy Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary with the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to offer Our friendly Mediation to both thoſe Kings, and to contribute his utmoſt diligence, for ſetling a Peace between them; Giving him ſuch further Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as We found neceſſary for that occaſion; a Copy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (they bearing Date the ninth of <hi>December</hi> laſt) is herewith delivered unto you; And whereas ſince that time, there hath been

For in the <hi>Sound</hi> where the Fleet was poſted, it was found that the Current ran ſo violently and uncertainly, and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently in every ſmall ſpace of diſtance; and the breadth of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ſo little, that if the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet had come, and he been obliged to fight, the place was ſuch as no Pilot knew how to work

There came with this Gentleman another, with a complement and civil Letter, from the Senator <hi>Roſenhaen,</hi> who brought him alſo a Paſport which he had not deſired, and a large Declaration in anſwer to his Letter, which contained a recapitulation of Complaints againſt the States Generals proceedings, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual thwarting of the <hi>Swedes</hi> intereſt. But he waved any particular debate thereupon, by advice of the other Embaſſadours deſigned for <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> then with him, reſerving it to the States conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and orders, and being however admitted, he was conducted in the Kings Coach, with that ſolemnity which is due to Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, to the Lodgings deſigned for his Reception, and three days entertainment. The <hi>Heer Huybert,</hi> Counſellour and Secretary to the States of <hi>Zealand,</hi> who had been joynt Colleague with <hi>Sling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> was alſo joyned with him in Commiſſion here, but being he did not Embark as ſoon as the other, and that he ſpent ſome time in giving the laſt Orders to the Chiefs of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, and in Conference with General <hi>Montague</hi> upon his; he did not arrive in the <hi>Sound,</hi> (where his Reception and Audience was the ſame in ſubſtance with the other,) till three days after. But the <hi>Heeren Vogelſang</hi> Counſellour and Syndick of <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> and <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:104469:53"/>a Gentleman of <hi>Frieſland,</hi> both, but more particularly deputed to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> arrived there the ſame day that <hi>Slingland</hi> did; they (as <hi>De Huybert</hi> alſo did) came in a man of War, and ſaluting the Caſtle with their great Guns, were repayed with the ſame civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Being landed, they were conducted to Court with Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and admitted into the Kings preſence, told him; that the States General were much troubled at the unhappy differences that were riſen betwixt the two Nations, and that they were and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways had been far from any thoughts of hoſtility againſt the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> only had not been wanting to their Allies in their extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, according to the Covenants made with them. They had therefore ſent them their Embaſſadours, to renew their old friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with their old friends, and to endeavour to remove thoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtandings and animoſities which were at preſent betwixt both Kings. The King having anſwered in order to theſe particulars, though in general terms, expreſſed himſelf no leſs deſirous of Peace than the States. The Embaſſadours being diſmiſſed, returned to their Ship, being waited upon thither with the ſame Ceremony they came; the next morning they ſailed to <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> where they were received and treated with as much ſplendidneſs, as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in a Town ſo long beſieged.<note place="margin">Jun. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> Amongſt other diſcourſe, they acquaint the King with the <hi>Treaty</hi> concluded in the <hi>Hague,</hi> betwixt the three States, and ſeriouſly invite his Majeſty to embrace the ſame, as moſt agreeing with the preſent eſtate of his affairs. But the King having thanked them civilly for their former favours, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted ſolemnly, that he had rather hazard all, than treat upon the foundation of the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> Treaty, and that with the excluſion of his Friends and Allies: He therefore beſought the continuance of their helping hand, as the true and ſafeſt means to a wiſhed Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation. Neither was the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> leſs averſe from that hated <hi>Treaty,</hi> however preſſed to accept of it, by the other Embaſſadours at his Court. And yet leſt he might ſeem to do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, he ordered Commiſſioners to argue the caſe with them, but their Conferences proved for the moſt part fruitleſs, and there was no great appearance, to put an end to the War in the three Weeks time prefixed by the three States. In the interim, there was no induſtry omitted in the Fortifying of <hi>Cronenburg;</hi> the beſt part of the Town of <hi>Elzineur</hi> next the Caſtle was thrown down to make way for the new Works, and near a thouſand Country people did labour day and night without any intermiſſion in the raiſing of them. <hi>Koege, Corſeur,</hi> and other places of <hi>Denmark,</hi> were likewiſe forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and the Camp before <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> ſtrengthened by highten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Walls, and enlarging of the Moat: By all which it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> had no mind to be diſcourſed out of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts and warm Quarters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>De Ruyter</hi> who had hitherto lain betwixt <hi>Leſow</hi> and <hi>Anout</hi> in order to the Truce, weighed Anchor, and being commanded by <hi>Opdam,</hi> came with his Fleet to <hi>Sampſo,</hi> that they might joyn with
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:104469:53"/>more eaſe and at pleaſure, when the three Weeks were expired, <hi>Opdam</hi> himſelf lay with his Fleet, and ſome <hi>Daniſh</hi> Veſſels, betwixt <hi>Spro</hi> and <hi>Komps,</hi> expecting the expiration of the Truce, which was yet prolonged for three Weeks more. For Monſieur <hi>Newport</hi> the States Embaſſadour in <hi>England,</hi> had made a new Ceſſation with the Uſurpers there, and that without the knowledge of his Superiours, the Counſel of State there having abſolutely inſiſted upon it, by reaſon their Commiſſioners deſigned for <hi>Denmark</hi> were not yet gone, and leſt any thing might happen before they could get thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, prejudicial to the Peace they all ſo much deſired.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>June</hi> 13.</note> The States ſeemed unſatisfied with this unexpected agreement, but yet leaſt they might ſeem likewiſe averſe from thoughts of an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they approved of it, and commanded their Admirals to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, but with that reſtriction, that they ſhould joyn For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon the expiration of the firſt three Weeks, and land their Land Militia in <hi>Coppenhagen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, whileſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet expected new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, an occaſion happened wherein the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> a ſingular good turn: For 28 ſail of <hi>Swedish</hi> ſhips, very good ones, were gone under the Command of young <hi>Wrangel,</hi> into the leſſer <hi>Belt,</hi> for the relief of <hi>Funen. Opdam</hi> and <hi>De Ruyter</hi> being newly joyned in the great <hi>Belt,</hi> were going to ſurpriſe this <hi>Swediſh</hi> Fleet, the news thereof coming to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Admiral, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſailed into the <hi>Belt,</hi> and there found the whole <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Fleet about ninety Sail, purſuing the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Fleet, and in ſight of them. But upon diſcovery of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet the <hi>Dutch</hi> tackt, and put themſelves into the great <hi>Belt,</hi> before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet, and came to an Anchor near <hi>Komps</hi> Iſland, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> off the Town of <hi>Callenburg;</hi> in the mean time, the <hi>Swedes</hi> delivered, in ſight of both Fleets, ſailed away towards the Iſle of <hi>Haſelin,</hi> and ſo for the <hi>Sound,</hi> where the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> queſtioned and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned young <hi>Wrangel</hi> for his ill Conduct. The <hi>Dutch</hi> apprehending the <hi>Engliſh</hi> advance, made ready for Fight, and the allarm laſted until <hi>Montague</hi>'s Ketch and Letters aſſured them, that they were friends, and had no other thoughts but of Amity and Peace. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon followed all the demonſtrations of kindneſs on both ſides, the Generals complementing each other by their Vice-Admirals, and the ſeveral Officers of the Fleet, viſiting, receiving, and feaſting each other, with all imaginable kindneſs and civility, and now the Ceſſation being already expired, the Chiefs themſelves mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and concluded a further continuation of it for three Weeks more.</p>
               <p>After both Fleets in the <hi>Belt</hi> had diſputed ſome ten days, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining ſome terms in the <hi>Hagues</hi> Treaty, which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral made his pretence, to go to the relief of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> he weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Anchor and ſailed by <hi>Haſelin</hi> into the <hi>Sound,</hi> and came to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor between <hi>Ween</hi> Iſland and <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> ſhutting the <hi>Dutch</hi> our of the Channel, and expecting the coming of new Embaſſadours
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:104469:54"/>from <hi>England,</hi> and lying in a Poſt advantageous to correſpond ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> or <hi>Elzineur,</hi> as occaſion offered; whileſt <hi>Opdam</hi> ſailed with his Fleet to <hi>Coppenhagen.</hi> The <hi>Danes</hi> who lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed within their Walls, clamoured againſt theſe noxious Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the loſs of <hi>Naskow</hi> heightened their murmurings and complaints, juſtly ſearing, leſt the whole burthen of the War might fall upon them, whileſt the great power of their Confederates ſeemed but idle Spectators in their Tragedy. This moved the King to preſs the States by re-iterated Meſſages and intreaties,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>June</hi> 24. <hi>July</hi> 31.</note> that they would not ſuffer <hi>Denmark</hi> to be wholly loſt, and ſuch vaſt and chargeable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations to be rendred fruitleſs, by their re-iterated Ceſſations. The Enemy had in them, taken all the Iſlands, and <hi>Naskow</hi> it ſelf in ſight of their Fleet; ſo that he had nothing now left but <hi>Coppen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagen</hi> only, and that ſtraitly beſieged, by Sea and Land. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> did fortifie the landing places of <hi>Zeland</hi> and <hi>Funen</hi> with all diligence; neither had they deſiſted from aſſaulting and taking the States own Ships in the leſſer <hi>Belt;</hi> by all which it appeared, how little hopes there were to bring theſe to reaſon by Ceſſations and Treaties: He did therefore earneſtly deſire them, and that by vertue of the League betwixt them, that they would ſend their Generals orders to obey his commands, and that until <hi>Denmark</hi> was delivered from the danger it was in, and the Enemy obliged to embrace a deſired and equitable Peace.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>July</hi> 1.22.22.</note> 
                  <hi>Cariſius</hi> the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Reſident in the <hi>Hague,</hi> urged the ſame by three ſeveral Memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, but all could not perſwade the States to recede from their late Conventions with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French.</hi> Monſieur <hi>De Thou</hi> had told them in their full Aſſembly, that if they did depart from the Treaty which they had concluded with ſo much difficulty, his King would alſo withdraw from the terms of Mediation, and help the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> according to his agreement with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with all his power. But their greateſt apprehenſions were from the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as neareſt, and upon the place, not that they feared their Forces, for they were themſelves double their numbers, but leſt they ſhould engage in a War, which might be eaſier begun than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But the apprehenſions of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> threats, did quickly vaniſh, for both Nations did ratifie the Treaty of the 21 of <hi>May,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners were daily expected at <hi>Elzineur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Bloody Faction, the diſgrace and Fag end of a Parliament, who had murthered their Soveraign, had alſo now caſhiered their pretended Protector, and having re-uſurped a Tyranny over their fellow-ſubjects, and the moſt noble <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, ſwayed and domineered at pleaſure: and thinking themſelves now ſecure at home, extended their ambition (the only commendable thing they did) to forreign parts. Amongſt others, the affairs of the North ſeemed moſt conſiderable,. They therefore diſpatched three Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners thither, Collonel <hi>Algernoon Sidney,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomas Boon,</hi> to whom they were pleaſed to add
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:104469:54"/>General <hi>Montague,</hi> as not daring to diſtruſt him, becauſe he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Fleet. (Though they ſent him no new Commiſſion to be Admiral, when they did ſend new ones to all the reſt of the Fleet.) But they excluded Sir <hi>Philip Medow,</hi> who had hitherto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged the whole Mediation, as jealous of his affection to their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Theſe Embaſſadours came with Inſtructions and Orders to mediate a Peace betwixt the warring Kings, upon the Baſis of the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> Treaty; they were alſo commanded to joyn Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and means with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> for the effecting of it according to the tenour of the <hi>Hagues</hi> Conventions, which obliged a mutual communication betwixt the three States. Theſe Embaſſadours ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Elzineur</hi> with a ſplendid train, where they were received and treated by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> with all manner of civilities and honour: the King himſelf was not there, being gone to <hi>Naskow,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>June</hi> 23.</note> then taken by his forces; they therefore ſtayed there in expectation of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, but to looſe no time, had daily Conferences with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadours, ſo that the whole Negotiation ſeemed to be carried on by common conſent; the <hi>Swedes</hi> were troubled at this intimacy and familiarity, affirming that it was wholly unpracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, that Embaſſadours ſent to a Forreign King, and not having ſeen that King to whom they were ſo deputed, ſhould in the mean time confer and treat with the Miniſters of other States, not friends of the ſaid King, and that in his own Court or Camp. But the Kings arrival put an end to theſe murmurings; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners went to <hi>Fredericksburg</hi> where he was, and being received in the way, by a party of Horſe and ſome Gentlemen, which the King had ſent to wait upon them, were conveyed to their Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Kings Coaches, accompanied with the Coaches of thoſe Publick Miniſters who were then at Court. Having repoſed a while; they were led to publick Audience, which paſſed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulations and mutual expreſſions of friendſhip. After Dinner, being admitted again to the Kings preſence, they unfolded the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of their Commiſſion, the ſum whereof was, the ſtory of the <hi>Hagues</hi> Treaty, which the three States had agreed upon and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſtand to: neither did they omit to tell him, with what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and affection, they had promoted his Majeſties Intereſt in the ſaid Convention. The King, who had expected better things from his friends he had ſo much relyed upon, was troubled at this diſcourſe. He found alſo that the ſtate of his affairs had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to them in a lower condition than they truly were in; and that by ſuch who either envied his felicity, or were ignorant of his condition: He therefore magnified, though modeſtly, the paſt and preſent, and making a Majeſteous reflexion upon his own Perſon and Conduct; told them, He did not deſpair of a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and a hoped iſſue to his undertakings. After this, the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors did all they could by joynt Counſels, by communication of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, by ſeveral Conferences with the two Kings their Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, and by their utmoſt endeavours, to compoſe the vaſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:104469:55"/>breaches betwixt theſe diſſenting Princes, but to little purpoſe; for the <hi>Danes</hi> would liſten to no Accommodation, that did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore them all that had been taken from them, and include their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; and the <hi>Swedes</hi> refuſed to ſtir out of <hi>Zeland,</hi> unleſs the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes and ſtrong places of <hi>Denmark,</hi> were left them as Pledges for the obſerving of the future Peace. The time ſeemed to be ſpent not in treating, but in fruitleſs and quarrelſome conteſtations; King <hi>Charles</hi> cauſed a large Declaration to be delivered to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> wherein, beginning at the Wars of <hi>Poland,</hi> he put them in mind of the injuries and offences he had received from the <hi>United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> not forgetting their Colluſion, as he called it, about the Treaty of <hi>Elbing.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadours on the other ſide; afterting their candor and deſire of Peace, profeſſed they were far from any thoughts of harm towards <hi>Sweden,</hi> propoſing nothing to themſelves but the ſecurity of their Confederates, and the freedom of their Commerce. About the ſame time, there were publiſhed two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective Manifeſto's, by the two Kings Orders, againſt each other. They were both ſevere and harſh in their expreſſions, but being both are in print, I thought fit, in order to the brevity I propoſe to my ſelf in this Relation, and out of the reverence I bear to ſuch great Princes,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>July</hi> 24/14.</note> to omit any further mention of them. Whileſt they thus cavil in <hi>Denmark,</hi> there was another Treaty concluded on in the <hi>Hague,</hi> betwixt the three States, more advantageous for the <hi>Danes</hi> than the former, for <hi>Drontheim</hi> was reſtored to them, by vertue thereof, in compenſation of the loſſes they had ſuſtained by this laſt invaſion. In this, as in the other Treaty of the 21 of <hi>May,</hi> the Miniſters reſiding with both the Kings, were injoyned, that they ſhould by joint Councels and Forces endeavour, and this in the ſpace of fourteen days time, to conclude a Peace upon the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis of the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> Treaty, except in what is excepted in this preſent agreement, or ſhould afterwards be changed by conſent of the two Kings. And laſtly, that they ſhould ſupport and aſſiſt with all their might, that Prince which ſhould declare for Peace, and compel the unwilling by force of Arms to accept of it. This Treaty was followed by another more forcible and nervous, wherein it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>July</hi> 25. <hi>Aug.</hi> 4.</note> that if the fourteen days mentioned in the ſecond Treaty were not begun, when this Convention ſhould be delivered to the Miniſters in <hi>Denmark,</hi> that then the ſaid term ſhould begin within four and twenty hours after the receipt thereof. And further, that the diſſenting King ſhould by the conjoyned Forces of <hi>England</hi> and the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> be without any intermiſſion of time compelled to receive and accept of Peace; this was the ſum of this third Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. But the States ſolicitous for <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> ſent ſecret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Orders to their Officers in Chief, that however af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs went, they ſhould have a care to conſerve the ſame, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard all, rather than ſuffer it to be loſt, or change Maſter. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ignorant of this myſtery, though they diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled it, being no leſs unwilling than the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to ſee this conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:104469:55"/>City, the ballance of the North, fall into the hands of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring <hi>Swede.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> full of ſcorn and indignation, to ſee the Law preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed him by others, reſolved not to treat but by the ordinary way of Commiſſioners. He did not abſolutely reject the amicable interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> but would by no means admit of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> his Enemies and actually in Arms againſt him, until the old and uſual friendſhip betwixt the two Nations were renewed. King <hi>Frederick</hi> on the other ſide, profeſſed he would do, much leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude nothing, without the Mediators, eſpecially the interpoſition of the <hi>United Provinces:</hi> although he did not deny, but that the Treaty begun and ripened by them, might be poliſhed and brought to perfection by the Commiſſioners of both Kings. <hi>Charles</hi> would not hear of quitting of <hi>Drontheym,</hi> without an equivalent, nor be perſeaded to determine any thing about the time of evacuation, or withdrawing his Army out of <hi>Denmark:</hi> and being urged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare himſelf, grew angry; proteſting though in private, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a King, and a Conquerour, and not inglorious, could not, nor would not ſuffer himſelf to be braved and controulled by two Commonwealths, whereof one had abdicated, and the other mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered their Prince. He was more in choller againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> than the other, becauſe he expected more kindneſs from them than any. Theſe he reproaches with parricide, and wonders they durſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him, with their hands reeking with the bloud of their own Soveraign: They ſhould therefore get them gone with their. Fleet, out of the reach of his Cannon, unleſs they meant to try their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. But this tranſport of rage and ſcorn, was but vented amongſt his Confidents. What he ſaid to the Embaſſadours themſelves in publick, ſome time after, was of no leſs conſequence or noiſe. The Plenipotentiaries of the two Commonwealths, had with commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour, framed a Concept or Form, which they called a <hi>Project</hi> (and which we will call ſo hereafter alſo) upon the Baſis of the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> Treaty, according to the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions agreed on at the <hi>Hague.</hi> This Project or Inſtrument of Peace, they firſt preſented to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who received it, and requiring time to deliberate upon it, promiſed an anſwer. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours hereupon went the ſame day to the Camp, and having obtained <hi>Steno Bielke</hi> the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Embaſſadours liberty,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 28.</note> (for he had been thus long detained priſoner at <hi>Coppenhagen</hi>) took him with them, fancying that ſo great a preſent would render their coming more acceptable. Being entred the Kings Lodging, and in the Anti-Chamber, his Majeſty after a little ſtay came out to them, where Collonel <hi>Sidney,</hi> accompanied with all his Colleagues, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadours (for the <hi>French</hi> had withdrawn himſelf) after a profound Reverence, preſented him a Rowl of Paper, being the aforeſaid <hi>Project.</hi> The King asked what Papers they were? <hi>Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> anſwered, that they contained the deſires of the three States. But the King replied with a ſtern countenance, if it be the <hi>Project</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:104469:56"/>for Peace, I will not receive it: And adding, told the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> as for you, I will not refuſe your Mediation, as long as you continue in the terms of friendſhip, but will ſuffer no Arbitrators: And then turning to the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſubjoyned, as for you, being you are my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, I abſolutely refuſe to receive you as Mediators: and to them all, You make your Projects in your Fleets, and I (clapping his hand upon his Sword) wear mine at my ſide. Having ſaid this, he left the Embaſſadours, and turning ſuddenly from them, went to the other ſide of the room. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadours follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him ſaid, we are not your Majeſties Enemies, and ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>prove your beſt friends. The King looking fiercely upon them, anſwered, my Embaſſadours are unworthily uſed and you are ſuffered to go and come at pleaſure. <hi>Slingland</hi> replied to this, We need fear nothing from a generous Prince; and the King abruptly, I have no great reſentments of generoſity for ſuch Enemies. The Embaſſadours would not provoke the offended King any further, but retiring with a profound and reſpectful Reverence, left the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; where His Majeſty having given <hi>Bielke</hi> his hand to kiſs rallied with his great Officers, moſt of them having been preſent at this audience, upon this unuſual rencounter. This indignity of offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Embaſſadours, was ſeconded with another, though not ſo conſiderable. They were ſcarce got into their Coaches, when it was told them, that the Trumpeter who waited upon them, was thrown into priſon. Being ſurpriſed with this Novelty, they ſent me to the King to complain of this violence, and breach of the Law of Nations. But the Trumpeter was immediately releaſed, and his detenſion excuſed, having happened without the Kings knowledge, and done by the Generals command, not with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to affront the Embaſſie, but becauſe he belonged to the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> which was very true.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> were over-joyed with this ill treatment of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours, fancying that the <hi>Dutch</hi> would now employ their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt the common Enemy, without any further intermiſſion, as well in revenge of their own injuries, as to aſſiſt their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. In the mean time, Poſts were diſpatched into all parts, with the news of this encounter, the circumſtances of it being aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, according to the ſeveral paſſions of the intereſſed. The States General were moſt netled at it, as being moſt concerned, and did not fail to exaggerate the affront done to the Embaſſadours of the three States by their Miniſters in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> as an indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty common to them all. But the Mediators, how ever ill received at their former Audience, did not yet deſpair of a deſired iſſue to their negotiation. They knew the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was not wholly averſe from Peace (for he had ſeveral times profeſſed he had not eſpouſed his Conqueſts, provided he did not quit them without a compenſation) but from the manner of compaſſing it; and he was not againſt the officious intervention of Mediators, though he could not endure the Umpirage of their Arbitration. The <hi>Dutch</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:104469:56"/>therefore ſeeing that he would never admit of their Mediation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the ancient Correſpondence and Amity betwixt him and them were firſt reſtored, drew a form of reconciliation, which ſhould put an end to all their former miſunderſtandings and Controverſies, and ſending it to <hi>Roſenhaen</hi> by the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour, wrote alſo to him, that they purpoſed to come to the Camp, to perfect the Treaty of <hi>Elbing</hi> and its Elucidations, and alſo to endeavour to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate the differences betwixt the two Kings. But being they perceived that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> looked upon the States as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and their Miniſters for that reaſon, as improper for the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation in hand, and that it ſeemed not good to His Majeſty, to aſſent to the aforeſaid elucidations, before the difference betwixt himſelf and the States General were removed, and the ancient friendſhip betwixt the two Nations reſtored: and being they doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted whether their coming to the Camp at that time might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable or not, they thought good to ſend an Inſtrument of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, with a promiſe that they would ſign it as ſoon as the Peace betwixt the two Kings was concluded.</p>
               <p>The day following the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadours being informed, that the King had not only laid by his choller, but that alſo he deſired their return to his Court, ſent me to him, to know whether their coming to the Camp, would be agreeable to his Majeſty or not?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 31.</note> And whether they ſhould be received according to their dignities, in caſe they came? I being returned, and having brought word that all was as they deſired, the Heeren <hi>Slingland</hi> and <hi>Huybert</hi> went to the Camp; where being civilly received by the Courtiers, they were immediatly introduced into the Kings preſence; where having firſt condoled with him for the death of the Duke of <hi>Holſteyn</hi> his father in Law, they urged what concerned the illuſtrations of the Treaty of <hi>Elbing,</hi> the Peace betwixt the two Crowns, and the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt His Majeſty and the States General. They moſt inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted upon the preſent Treaty, and preſſed the King, that he would be pleaſed to declare himſelf as to the main heads of it, and grant his Letters of ſafe conduct for the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Commiſſioners, in ſuch manner and form as was required. The King anſwered, that he deſired nothing more than to cultivate the ancient friendſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Sweden</hi> and the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and had therefore ſent <hi>Coyet</hi> his Embaſſadour Extraordinary into <hi>Holland,</hi> to repreſent to the States General themſelves, the candor of his intentions in that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. As for the Peace, he was not averſe from it, provided it were ſafe and honourable; only he believed that the buſineſs would advance beſt, if it were carried on by Commiſſioners of both ſides, according to the uſual method betwixt the Northern Crowns. The Conference being done, the Embaſſadours returned to <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> being followed by Monſieur <hi>Terlon</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour, who brought with him the deſired Paſports for the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. There was no little difficulty on both ſides, about the titles of the two Kings, to be inſerted in the ſaid Paſports. The <hi>Danes</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:104469:57"/>refuſed to acknowledge the new Duke of <hi>Schonen,</hi> and the <hi>Swedes</hi> would not relinquiſh their acquired honours; but a middle way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propoſed by the <hi>Dutch</hi> was embraced by both, to wit, that King <hi>Charles</hi> ſhould only write himſelf King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and King <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> only King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> without any further additional titles, on either ſide. The Letters of ſafe Conduct being granted by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> others of the ſame tenour were required from the <hi>Danes,</hi> which they differring to give under pretence of new difficulties, were preſſed to it by a Memorial, delivered to their King by the Commiſſioners of the two Commonwealths. In it, they deſired His Majeſty,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 1.</note> being the Treaty could not begin, much leſs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, without the required Paſports for the <hi>Swedes</hi> Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that he would forthwith grant them, leſt the procraſtination of the ſo much wiſhed for Peace, ſhould lye at his door. The King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received this Writing, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſafe Conduct with it, ſent alſo his, writ in <hi>Daniſh,</hi> by the Lord <hi>Peter Redes</hi> one of his Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, to the Mediators; with a Declaration, wherein he profeſſed that he would ſend Commiſsioners to perfect the Peace with the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> provided the ſaid King would declare his mind concerning the further Contents of the preſent Declaration. But being there were ſeveral Clauſes in the ſaid Declaration, not only offenſive to the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> but alſo diſpleaſing to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> beſides the ſtop it was like to put to the Treaty it ſelf, the King was again earneſtly deſired both by Word and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting by the Mediators, that omitting his late Declaration, its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and reſtrictions; he would be pleaſed to ſend his Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners to the place appointed, inſtructed with ſuch powers, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as ſhould be neceſſary for the happy Concluſion of the preſent Negotiation, leſt (which they did abhor to think on) they ſhould be neceſſitated to judge that he had no thoughts of Peace, being he refuſed the means by which it was to be effected. The King ſeeing himſelf ſo ſharply preſſed by the Mediators, did at length deliver them a more ſatisfactory Declaration,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 5.</note> whereby he did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to all that was deſired, as far as agreeing with the Decrees of the three Sates, of the 11/21 of <hi>May,</hi> 14/24 of <hi>July,</hi> and the 25/4 Jul./Aug. The <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour went the ſame day to the Camp, with this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration and Letters of ſafe Conduct, and though the <hi>Swedes</hi> deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſome things in them to be changed, that was alſo aſſented to. The day following the Lords <hi>Roſenhaen</hi> and <hi>Bielke</hi> came from the Camp, and the Lords <hi>Pasberg</hi> and <hi>Magnus Hoeg,</hi> from the City, and met in the Tents pitched about the mid-way betwixt the City and Camp: the Deputies of the three States were likewiſe aſsiſting at this Conference, in whoſe preſence the two Kings Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners having ſaluted each other in their proper idioms profeſſed their mutual deſires and endeavours for peace: the <hi>Danes</hi> did mainly urge, that the moſt material things ſhould be firſt treated on, and that without delay; and having delivered a Paper to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> demanded, that being the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had been unexpected<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:104469:57"/>invaded, even then when he hoped to enjoy the real effects of the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> treaty; that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhould forthwith reſtore unto him all the Provinces, Lands, Forts, Places and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, which he was obliged to ſurrender by vertue of the ſaid Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

And laſtly, that the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> Confederates ſhould be duly included in this Treaty. The <hi>Swedes</hi> on the other ſide, did urge that a more fit place ſhould be choſen to treat in, and that the parties ſhould agree upon the manner and form of treating, before they entered upon the buſineſs it ſelf. As for the Mediators, they would not refuſe their Amicable intermedling in greater difficulties; but if they intended to direct or decide matters, by vertue of their <hi>Hagues</hi> Conventions, or any other pretext whatſoever, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed it could not be, as being a thing without example, and not to be admitted by the Kings themſelves, without a manifeſt intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon their dignities and honour. Two days after they met again, and the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Rotſchild</hi> was reaſſumed and read by the Commiſſioners of both ſides, but being there aroſe ſeveral conteſts about its third Article, the explication of it was referred by the <hi>Danes</hi> to the Mediators: theſe taking hold of the occaſion, went to the <hi>Swedes</hi> into their Tents, and delivering them the projected <hi>Treaty</hi> which they had formerly preſented their King, deſired them to recommend it to His Majeſty, and entreat his ſpeedy anſwer to it; the <hi>Swedes</hi> Commiſſioners received the <hi>Treaty</hi> though not without ſome difficulty, with promiſe they would preſent it to His Majeſty, and enquire into his pleaſure concerning it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Commiſſioners ſeeing that the Dayes of Ceſsation from Arms was paſt (for they were as well Generals as Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours) wrote to their Admiral <hi>Opdam,</hi> that whereas the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had poſitively refuſed his Declaration for Peace, and that the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> had ſatisfied the deſires of the three States, he ſhould therefore make War upon the <hi>Swedes</hi> where he could meet with them, relieve the City, in as much as in him lay with proviſions, and haſten <hi>De Ruyter</hi> whom they daily expected, with all poſſible ſpeed. In the laſt <hi>Hagues</hi> Convention, it was agreed; that the Plenipotentiaries of both Commonwealths, ſhould delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and determine amongſt themſelves, what force and what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ships they thought ſufficient to carry on the deſign in <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> and that the reſt, as ſuperfluous and extream expenſive, ſhould be ſent to their reſpective homes again: the truth was, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſsadours had Orders, not to diſmiſs above twenty of their Ships, nor thoſe but with this precaution, that the remaining
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:104469:58"/>ſhould be ſufficient to execute the Convention of the twenty fourth of <hi>July.</hi> neither ſhould the ſaid Ships be Licenſed but with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> not before them, and by no means after them, and that the number of the diſmiſsed Veſsels, ſhould by no means exceed that of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but if poſſible be leſs. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> ignorant of this, preſsed that the preciſe number of Ships which were to Winter in <hi>Denmark,</hi> ſhould be determined, but being the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to divide their Fleet as yet, General <hi>Montague</hi> declared in the name of his Colleagues, that being the Dutch Commiſſioners would not define, according to the Conventions betwixt the two Commonwealths, how many of their Ships ſhould joyn with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual number of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men of War, and how many of both Fleets ſhould after the ſaid conjunction be returned home, they were reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, wanting alſo proviſions for ſo great a multitude, to ſend their whole Fleet back into <hi>England.</hi> This, he ſaid, they did not with an intent to depart from the Conventions betwixt the two Commonwealths, or that they had any new deſign on foot, but really forced to it through want of neceſſaries, for the ſubſiſtence of ſo great a Fleet. The <hi>Dutch</hi> ſeemingly endeavoured to divert the <hi>English</hi> from this reſolution, and ſhewing them where and in what manner, they might procure what proviſions they pleaſed, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought them, being the common Intereſt was to be carried on with common and conjoyned power, they would not withdraw theirs, ſeeing that could not be without a diminution of the dignity and credit of the two Commonwealths, a weakening of their Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the two Kings, and a manifeſt retarding of the preſent Negotiation. After this, ſeveral Propoſitions were made concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the number of Ships to be left behind, and the <hi>English</hi> were invited to leave only fifteen of theirs, whileſt the whole <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet continued there until further Orders from the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, but yet with this reſtriction, that they ſhould attempt nothing without communication of Councels with the <hi>English</hi> Plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiaries, and being the <hi>English</hi> were averſe from ſuch odds, and ſo them a ſolemn Inſtrument of Aſſurance under their hands and ſeals; and that one of their Commiſſioners ſhould (as a further teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their candor and ſincerity) not only truſt his perſon in the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, but continue in the ſame, to communicate Councels with <hi>Montague,</hi> and deliberate of what ſhould concern the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of their affairs, according to emergencies. <hi>Sidney</hi> did here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon confeſs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 5.</note> that they had no Orders to ſend away their Fleet at all, but on the contrary, commands to obſerve the <hi>Hagues</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. But <hi>Montague,</hi> of whoſe mind <hi>Honniwood</hi> and <hi>Boon</hi> alſo was, being urged to declare himſelf, anſwering very ambiguouſly, broke the conference, and next day leaving <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> went to the <hi>Sound,</hi> and having ſaluted King <hi>Charles</hi> at <hi>Cronenburg,</hi> where he was royally treated, and all his chief Officers and Captains honoured with Preſents, he ſailed with his whole Fleet towards
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:104469:58"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> then full of Commotion and tumult. The ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of the Admiral, ſurpriſed and troubled the minds of all parties: The <hi>Swedes</hi> were grieved that the <hi>Sound,</hi> their Havens, and the Sea, lay now open to the prevailing <hi>Dutch,</hi> whileſt the <hi>Danes</hi> interpreting all things in the worſt ſenſe, fancied that <hi>Montague</hi> was therefore gone, becauſe he would not now war againſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> now openly refuſing Peace; and that all thoſe Truces extorted hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto from the States General, had been prolonged in favour of their Enemies. The <hi>Dutch</hi> alſo ſeemed to condemn this with-draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as happening contrary to their Treaties, and even then when they were to act by vertue of them. But this was but in outward ſhew, for they did inwardly rejoyce that this Imperious Fleet was gone, and they at length at liberty to act without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul. But <hi>Sidney</hi> and his Colleagues were more really trouble at the abſence of their Forces, not being ignorant how weak their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes were like to prove againſt an armed Mediation. They were alſo more nearly grieved at the Admirals return, as ſenſible of the great forces he commanded, and his averſeneſs to the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And truly they were not deceived, for whileſt all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> weary of the tyranny of the Regicides, prepared to vindicate their Liberties by Arms, requiring tacitely their Prince, but open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Free Parliament. <hi>Montague</hi> being invited and commanded by the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> into whoſe grace and favour he had lately been reſtored, haſtened thither with his Naval forces, to aſſiſt thoſe juſt, however unfortunate endeavours.</p>
               <p>The day after <hi>Montague</hi>'s departure, the Commiſsioners met a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the Tents, where the <hi>Danes</hi> demanded an Anſwer to their former Propoſals, declaring withall, that their King induced by the deſires and perſwaſions of the Mediators, had conſented to, and would willingly accept of their Project for Peace, ſo far forth as it agreed with the <hi>Hagues</hi> Conventions. They therefore deſired to know whether the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had likewiſe done it, proteſting they would otherwiſe proceed no further. The <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadours preſſed the ſame, urging the <hi>Swedes</hi> to declare, what Orders their King had given, in anſwer to their juſt Propoſitions. <hi>Roſenhaen</hi> being thus put to it, replied, that they had indeed deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered their King the Mediators Project, profeſsing further that His Majeſty would omit nothing on His part for the compaſsing of an equitable and honourable Peace; to which end he declared, that the Mediatours endeavours ſhould be moſt acceptable to him, provided they interpoſed only when they were required, and that as friends, not Arbitrators; leaving the diſpoſing of affairs, to the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of both Kings. This he ſaid was His Majeſties reſolution, who could not chuſe but wonder, to ſee that a Treaty made at the <hi>Hague,</hi> by the three States, and that without his knowledge, ſhould be alſo obtruded upon him, and that without his conſent. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther added, that it was a thing wholly unpractical, that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths ſhould preſcribe Laws to Kings at pleaſure, and never heard
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:104469:59"/>of in Hiſtory, that Mediatours ſhould undertake to preſs or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel diſſenting Princes, even againſt their wills, to accept of their fancies and conceptions, as Laws. This therefore being ſo, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty could not anſwer to thoſe kind of propoſals: But if they would treat after the old faſhion, and according to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod hitherto obſerved betwixt the <hi>Northern Crowns,</hi> he did not doubt, but the way to the ſo much deſired Peace, would be plain and eaſie. Monſieur <hi>Terlon</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour, arrived there at the ſame time, and declared to the Mediators, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners had truly and fully told them the Kings ſenſe, in order to the preſent tranſaction, as he himſelf had underſtood it from His Majeſties own mouth at <hi>Cronenburg,</hi> from whence he came; ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that he was very angry with <hi>Roſenhaen</hi> and <hi>Bielke,</hi> for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their <hi>Project</hi> without his orders, and had not pardoned them, if he had not mainly interceded for them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadours being returned to <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> ſent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to <hi>De Ruyter</hi> and <hi>Everſon,</hi> to act with all their Forces both by Sea and Land, againſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and make war upon them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they met with them. The next day they gave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Miniſters notice of what they had done, which could not at all (as they affirmed) retard the Peace, which was (being it could not be procured otherwiſe) to be thus ſought for according to the intention of the three States. In the mean time, they perſwaded them to continue their endeavours, and that with joynt advice, to which alſo they would contribute their utmoſt. As for the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Tents, they declared they could not, and that for weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reaſons, come thither any more, until it appeared that the <hi>Swedes</hi> did accept of the States Generals Mediation, and would receive their Embaſſadours according to their dignity. The reſt of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators acknowledged that the <hi>Dutch</hi> had done nothing contrary to the Covenants betwixt them, and promiſed that they would not act as Mediators any more, but conjoyntly with them.</p>
               <p>But the Treaty did not break off for all this: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> after Communication with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> meet the <hi>Swedes</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; who propounded <hi>Rotſchild</hi> or <hi>Elzineur,</hi> as fitter and more convenient places to treat in, which the <hi>Danes</hi> did not only oppoſe, but the <hi>Dutch</hi> alſo abſolutely reject, being unwilling to remove ſo far from the City or Sea. Two days after, <hi>Sidney</hi> and <hi>Terlon</hi> retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the Camp, to ſee whether the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had yet gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven any Anſwer either to the <hi>Danes</hi> Demands, or to the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the three States, but in vain, for the <hi>Swedes</hi> Commiſſioners did plainly tell them, that it would be but loſt labour to inſiſt any more upon this way, for the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Demands were couched in ſuch general terms, that it would be to no purpoſe to Anſwer them ſo; and as for the <hi>Project</hi> propoſed by the Mediators, they poſitively declared, that the King would hazard all, and venture his own life, rather than to ſubmit to the dictates of others, being he could not do it, without infringing his honour, and his reputation. Laſtly,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:104469:59"/>they proteſted he deſired nothing more then Peace, provided it were not impoſed upon him, and propoſed, (being the Tents were no fit place to treat and meet in, by reaſon of the cold and approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Winter) that they ſhould all go to <hi>Rotſchild, Elzineur,</hi> or <hi>Fredericksburg,</hi> as more proper for ſo celebrious an Aſſembly. The Mediators ſeeing the <hi>Swedes</hi> immoveable and reſolved,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 11, 12, 13.</note> deſired the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> that he would be pleaſed not only to continue the Treaty, which they did not yet deſpair of perfecting, but alſo to change the place for one of thoſe already propoſed, as more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. But the King replied, that this could not be, before the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had declared, as himſelf had done, that he would accept of that form which the Mediators had preſented, and given his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the five aforementioned Articles. The Embaſſadours were not well pleaſed with this Declaration of the Kings, eſpecially the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> who ſeemed now to doubt whether of the two Kings was moſt refractory, or ought to be eſteemed leaſt deſirous of Peace. Hereupon the Embaſſadours went again to Court, and preſſed the King ſo far, that he was content, (though with much ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging) to joyn the Lord <hi>Geſdorf,</hi> his chief Miniſter of State, to his other Commiſſioners; but upon condition, that the States Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals Fleet and Land-Forces, ſhould continue to proſecute the War againſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> until the Treaty were brought to a deſired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. And thus the Treaty was re-aſſumed, but the place of treating was not changed, only the Tents were taken away, and Houſes made of Plancks, of better proof againſt the extremity of the Weather, raiſed in their places. The Commiſſioners did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſometimes meet, though their Conventions proved wholly fruitleſs, theſe conteſts for Peace being neceſſitated to give way to the more clamorous and more ſevere diſputes of War.</p>
               <p>During theſe traverſes and treaties, <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> continued block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by Sea and Land. The <hi>Swedes</hi> had lain before the Haven the whole Summer, with four, ſometimes five Ships, ſo that the City laboured with the want of all things, eſpecially freſh Meats and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets lay uſeleſs in the Great <hi>Belt,</hi> kept up by Ceſſations or contrary Winds, and could not help them; whileſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> lying betwixt the Town and the Iſland of <hi>Ween</hi> as Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trals, did not aſſiſt them; until the General being advertiſed by me, who was newly come from Court, and had ſeen the miſeries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (a few Herrings and a piece of ſalt Beef, being the beſt <hi>regalie</hi> at the Kings Table) did ſend a Veſſel fraught with all manner of Fowl and freſh Meats, for the Kings children.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>July</hi> 7, 17.</note> The Court moved with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Generals munificence, ſent two Senators in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man of War, which I procured them from him, to complement and thank him. They were received by the Admiral, with all ſort of honour befitting their qualities, to whom, after the uſual expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of gratitude and kindneſs, they repreſented and recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the afflicted condition of their affairs; and leſt they might be thought to yield in civility to the generous General, they returned
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:104469:60"/>his favour with an Honorary of <hi>Rheniſh</hi> Wine. After this, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens received ſeveral conſiderable refreſhments from other parts. The Embaſſadours, both <hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> did ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſide in the City, but had their proviſions from abroad, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the <hi>Swedes,</hi> under which pretence their ſervants car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried great quantities into the Town, the ſurplus whereof they ſold at good rates to the eager buyers. The <hi>Swedes</hi> were not ignorant of this kind of Commerce, but connived at it, as ſharing in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits;<note place="margin">

But this traffick ended with the coming of the <hi>Dutch</hi> fleet, which arrived at <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> the ſecond day after <hi>Montagues</hi> depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who from the beginning of <hi>June</hi> to this time, had lain betwixt <hi>Ween</hi> and <hi>Zeland,</hi> as if he would cover the <hi>Sound</hi> on this ſide, as he had formerly done it on the other, when he hovered betwixt <hi>Lap</hi> and <hi>Koll. De Ruyter</hi> the day after his arrival, ſailed towards the <hi>Sound,</hi> and having blocked up the Haven of <hi>Lanskrown</hi> continned there. There lay two men of War under <hi>Cronenburg,</hi> which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figned to ruine, but his Fireſhips failing him, he attempted them no further, the loſs which he might ſuffer in the enterpriſe, not countervailing the victory. It ſeemed likewiſe too hazardous, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Haven of <hi>Lanskrown,</hi> though the ruine of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Fleet which lay in it ſeemed infallible, the difficulty was to get out again through ſo many Volleys, which the Caſtle and Batteries on ſhore, might thunder upon them, eſpecially if the Wind proved contrary. Beſides, it may reaſonably be thought that the <hi>Dutch</hi> deſign was not to deſtroy, but to humble the <hi>Swedes.</hi> However it was, they conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves with lying before the Haven at preſent, and ſhutting up the Enemy within his receptacles. But leſt the Fleet might ſeem to do nothing at all, Collonel <hi>Killegrew,</hi> who commanded the Land forces at preſent on board,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 21.</note> was ſent with 1200 commanded men, 11 ſhips of War, and 7 Fluyts, under the direction of <hi>Cornelius E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſon</hi> Rear-Admiral of <hi>Zeland,</hi> to intercept <hi>Keucks.</hi> King <hi>Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick</hi> had been advertiſed by his Spies, that there were not above 200 men in the Town, and the Works on the ſide next the Sea were open, which was true; But the <hi>Swedes</hi> having notice of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign before hand, had filled the place with armed men. King <hi>Charles</hi> was come thither alſo in perſon, and all things were in a readineſs to receive theſe new gueſts. <hi>Killegrew</hi> knowing nothing of theſe preparations, was advanced within a League and a half of the Town, with intention to fail up cloſe to it, but a ſudden calm pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting him, he was forced to expect the day, which diſcovered the Enemies countenance and numbers, and poſture; ſo that fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that inſtead of ſurprizing them, he ſhould be inevitably loſt himſelf, he commanded his men, (four hundred whereof had been put into Boats with deſign to land) back to the Fleet, which was no ſooner done, but the Enemies bodies of Horſe which had
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:104469:60"/>lurked in the Wood appeared, as alſo the danger they had infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly run into, if the Wind had continned blowing an hour longer. The <hi>Danes</hi> had at the ſame time ſurpriſed <hi>Udſtead</hi> a Town in <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,</hi> which <hi>Killegrew</hi> having notice of, had Orders likewiſe to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten thither to their Succour, which he did, but they had diſlod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged before he could get to them, for the place was not very tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the Enemy made head on all ſides againſt them. Having therefore met them by the way, they returned all together to <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhagen,</hi> with a purpoſe to land the Auxiliaries, which had thus long languiſhed on Shipboard: but they were much ſurpriſed to ſee the Citizens refuſe them entry, who fearing peradventure ſuch nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ayds, told them plainly, they were ſtrong enough to defend themſelves. This refuſal, did much cool the <hi>Dutch</hi> kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, who not examining whether their diffidence were juſt or not, took it ill to be denied any thing from them, who owed them for all they enjoyed. Beſides, the Land ſouldiers were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſubjected to ſickneſſes, as being out of their Element, and obliged by this ſtay, to conſume thoſe Proviſions which were only deſigned for the Seamen. Neither were the <hi>Danes</hi> content to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only, they deſigned alſo the recovery of <hi>Cronenburg,</hi> which had probably been effected, if not diſcovered by a miracle.</p>
               <p>The men of <hi>Elzineur</hi> were the contrivers of this Plot, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gained ſome of the Gariſon, thought the Victory ſecure. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight hundred men worked daily at the New Fortifications, and the Countrey was ſummoned to carry Wood, and Fuel for the Proviſion of the Caſtle. The deſign was to arm thoſe Car-men, who were nigh fourſcore ſtrong, with ſhort Swords and Piſtols, who were ordered to overturn a Waggon or two in the very entry of the Caſtle, and thereupon to call their Companions to their aid, as if it had been done by accident. Being come together, they were to fall immediatly upon the Guard at the Gate, whileſt the Townſmen, who were ready in their Houſes, ſhould haſten to their aſſiſtance, and the aforeſaid Workmen be invited with their Spades and Mattocks, inſtead of other arms, to their liberty, and to the ſpoil. The plot being thus laid, the Contrivers and chief Actors in it, who had given the Court intelligence of it, were mainly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by promiſes thence, and the glory of Delivering their Country, to dare any thing; which they had infallibly put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, if they had not been ſtrangely diſcovered. The man that carried their Letters to <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> and brought them their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and directions thence, had paſſed ſeveral times with a little Boat, as if he had gone a fiſhing along the ſhore, betwixt the Town and City. He had often ſlipped by the men of War undiſcerned, which was no hard matter, conſidering the diſtance they lay from the ſhore, the largeneſs of the Sea, and the favour of the night. It happened, that in going by, he ſaw the Admirals Long-boat put off, which frightened him into a fancy that it was after him, and fearing to be taken, he threw his Packet of Letters with a Stone
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:104469:61"/>tied at them into the Sea, and made away with all the haſt he could. But when he ſaw that the <hi>Swede</hi> had taken another Courſe, as not minding him, he then began to condemn his vain fear and precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; however glad, that his Letters which the Sea had ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were not faln into the Enemies hands. But he was deceived, for the ſtring that tied the Packet to the ſtone being ſlipt, or broke, the Letters floated, and were carried by the Tide, which in the Streights of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">

               <p>The Plot to ſurpriſe <hi>Malmuyen</hi> one of the Chief Towns of <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,</hi> was no leſs odly diſcovered, than this of <hi>Cronenburg,</hi> the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers that were employed by the Conſpirators, uſed to hide their Letters in a Wood, in a hole covered with Earth and Sods, where they alſo found their Anſwers; ſo that the buſineſs was come to ſome ripeneſs, when an unhappy Fox ranging that way, and ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at that new Earth, ſcarp'd it up in ſearch of ſomewhat to prey upon. This being obſerved by an accidental Paſſenger, who curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſee what the induſtrious beaſt was doing, found the Letters which contained and detected the whole progreſs of the conjura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I cannot tell how truly I have related the particulars of theſe Conſpiracies, though they were thus told me by ſeveral perſons of credit: but being I dare not affirm them in all their particulars though they are moſt true in the general (as the reſt of this Relation for undoubted certainties) the Reader may take the ſame li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in believing what he pleaſes, as I did in writing of them.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Denmark</hi> having at length obtained permiſſion to employ the <hi>Dutch</hi> Auxiliaries, thought fit to undertake ſomewhat of conſequence before Winter. Having therefore got together all the ſmall Veſſels and Ships of burthen which the City could afford, <hi>de Ruyter</hi> was by conſent of the States Embaſſadours, ſent with all his Fleet towards <hi>Holſteyn,</hi> with Order to embark the Land-Army that was there, and carry it according to ſuch directions as he had or ſhould receive. Whileſt he was on his way thiether, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the prayers and wiſhes of the Citizens for his good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, Admiral <hi>Opdam,</hi> who had kept the Sea the whole Summer, came to <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 26.</note> bringing with him a great number of Veſſels loaden with Fuel and other Proviſions. His ſtay there was not long, ſo that having taken his leave of the King (who regaled him with a Preſent of three thouſand pounds, and three hundred pounds yearly for his ſon, in conſideration of his eminent ſervices) and of the City which he had ſaved; he paſſed the <hi>Sound</hi> the ſecond time, diſcharging his Cannon at the Caſtles as he ſailed by,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nov.</hi> 4.</note> and after twelve Moneths abſence, arrived ſafe in <hi>Holland,</hi> where having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the States a ſummary Report of his actions, and negotiations in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:104469:61"/>the North, he received (though not without ſome oppoſition) the publick thanks of the Aſſembly, for his prudent and valorous Conduct.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Charles</hi> was gone to <hi>Nykopping</hi> in <hi>Falſter,</hi> where he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued ſome time, to be nearer <hi>Pomeranta,</hi> where the Confederates domineered at pleaſure, and the better to obſerve the motion of the <hi>Dutch Fleet.</hi> Collonel <hi>Sidney</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Honniwood,</hi> as alſo the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour, not yet deſpairing of Peace, went thither to him; which the <hi>Dutch</hi> being looked upon as Enemies, refuſed to do: but yet that it might appear how deſirous they were of an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, they diſpatched me with Letters and Meſſages, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating ſo much to His Majeſty. The Plenipotentiaries being arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at <hi>Nykopping,</hi> began to treat again, but being nothing could be concluded without the <hi>Dutch,</hi> it was thought good to invite them alſo thither, which was done by Letters from the Court, from the Embaſſadours, and from me, by the Kings order and the other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours entreaty. They had alſo Paſsports ſent them from the King, and a Convoy, with ſome of His Majeſties ſervants to wait upon them and ſerve them by the way, ſo that there appeared now more hopes than ever, of compoſing theſe ruinous differences. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to <hi>Nycopping;</hi> they were lodged and defrayed by the Kings Order, and the Treaty was re-aſſumed with no leſs expectation, than ſeeming propenſion to a Peace on all ſides. But theſe flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes quickly vaniſhed, for the King Perſiſting in his former opinion, and the Embaſſadors not departing from theirs, there was nothing concluded.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Octob.</hi> 25.</note> The <hi>Swedes</hi> Commiſſioners having exhibited ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious demands to the Mediatours, declared, that they muſt be firſt granted, before they could come to the main buſineſs of Peace. Theſe were, that the three States ſhould firſt joyntly and generally, and then ſeverally, and apart, ſtand good and be bound for the performance of the Treaty with <hi>Denmark.</hi> That they ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake, that the War which the Emperour and Electour of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg</hi> had raiſed in <hi>Germany,</hi> and did actually wage againſt the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Provinces there, in favour of <hi>Denmark,</hi> ſhould be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide with all ſpeed, and a plenary reſtitution made of all they had taken therein; and that they ſhould become Sureties that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhould not be diſturbed for the future, by any, contrary to the <hi>German</hi> Inſtrument of Peace. Further, in caſe the aforeſaid Enemies ſhould refuſe to reſtore what they had violently uſurped, that then the three States ſhould compel them to it by force, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe and engage, for the <hi>Swedes</hi> future defence and fecurity in thoſe Provinces, which appertained to them. Laſtly, theſe things being thus granted, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> would then condeſcend (in favour of the three States) to a Peace with <hi>Denmark,</hi> and that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Baſis of the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> Treaty, taken in its right and genuine ſence, which could not otherwiſe be done. The Mediatours an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to theſe Demands, that the three States would become
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:104469:62"/>ſureties for, and engage themſelves to aſſert what ever ſhould be agreed upon betwixt the Kings. That (as ſoon as the Peace was made in <hi>Denmark</hi>) they would uſe their utmoſt endeavours to compoſe the Wars in <hi>Germany,</hi> and oblige the Emperour and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> to reſtore thoſe places they had taken from the <hi>Swedes.</hi> That the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhould for his part, in the interim conſent to a pacification according to the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> Treaty, ſave that the ſecond Article of it ſhould be ſo interpreted, that either, and both of the Kings, ſhould be at liberty to Treat and make Leagues with any Prince, or Commonwealth whatſoever, for the mutual defence of themſelves and States. That all dubious expreſſions in the ſaid <hi>Treaty,</hi> ſhould be explained or expunged, to impede new diſputes. That the Caſtle, City, and Territory of <hi>Drontkeym,</hi> ſhould be reſtored to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> in conſideration of all thoſe vaſt loſſes which he had ſuffered by this laſt invaſion; And laſtly, that there ſhould be a time prefixed for the removal of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Garriſons and Armies, out of all the Iſles and Provinces of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and that in all other things and particulars, the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Rotſchild</hi> ſhould ſtand in full force and vigour. They made alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther propoſitions, concerning a free paſſage through the <hi>Sound,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout removing of miſunderſtandings betwixt the <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>United Provinces,</hi> the Ratification of the Treaty of <hi>Elbing,</hi> the Peace with <hi>Poland,</hi> and of reſtoring the old friendſhip, betwixt the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg.</hi> And theſe were the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals made on the King and Mediators ſides, but his Majeſty ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the moſt refractory, not that he was averſe from Peace, for he had too many Enemies to ſtruggle with, but leſt he might be thought to deſire it for fear of War, and even then when he was moſt threatned.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the dayes were paſſed in Feaſting and Hunting, the King having then invited the Mediators to thoſe diverſions. His Majeſty was at Table with the ſaid Embaſſadours, when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the news of the Enemies Fleet and Land-Armies being at Sea; neither did he therefore quit his Gueſts, but concealing the matter, continued his feaſting till late in the night. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning betimes, he ſurrounded the Iſland, viewed its Forts, and left good Guards at all its Entries &amp; Avenues, in caſe the Enemy ſhould attempt to land there; but being advertiſed by quick Poſts, and manifold Beacons, which he had ordered upon all the heights in the Country, that the Fleet was entred the <hi>Creat Belt,</hi> he flew with all the Forces he could get together to <hi>Corſeur,</hi> a Sea Town in <hi>Zeland:</hi> Being come thither, he perceived that the Enemies deſign was upon <hi>Funen.</hi> He therefore ſent Field-Marſhal <hi>Steynboch</hi> thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea, with Orders to the Prince of <hi>Sutlsbach,</hi> to quit the Iſland, and tranſport himſelf and all his Forces (leaving only a Garriſon in <hi>Newburg</hi>) into <hi>Zeland.</hi> But theſe Orders came too late, for they
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:104469:62"/>did not only want ſhipping in <hi>Funen,</hi> but the whole Streight was covered with the Enemies numerous Fleet. The King ſeeing this, diſpatcht an Expreſs to His Admiral, to haſten thither with the Fleet which lay in the Haven of <hi>Lanskrown,</hi> with all poſſible ſpeed. He being upon the Point to hoiſt ſail, received contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commands to ſtay, which were again followed by other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to come away; and yet others in the neck of them not to ſtir, and all in one and the ſame day: ſo uncertain he was what to determine. One while he reſolved to fight them at Sea, but finding the odds too great, would paſs over into <hi>Funen</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. He fretted to ſee the Enemy brave it in his preſence, and could not ſuffer that his Army ſhould engage in his abſence. But he had no ſhipping ready, and the Enemy were abſolutely Maſters at Sea, ſo that it was impoſsible for him either to fight them, or joyn with his own Troops.</p>
               <p>And thus this brave Prince, being hurried betwixt the paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of hope, and a generous fear, was forced againſt his Nature and practiſe, to become a Spectator, whileſt others plaid his part, but with their own Fortune.</p>

The <hi>Germans, Poliſh,</hi> and <hi>Brandenburger</hi> ayds marched by Land, under the Conduct of Field-Marſhal <hi>Eberſteyn,</hi> towards <hi>Middlefare,</hi> where they were to paſs over into <hi>Funen,</hi> ſome ſhips of War having been ſent thither to facilitate their tranſport.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:104469:64"/>by the ill-Weather, the Wind blowing high and contrary, they returned again to the Fleet, without attempting what they were ſent for. And truly it was wel they did not, for the deſcent there was, by reaſon of the Enemies frequent Forts and numerous troops, very difficult and hazardous; As ſoon as the day appeared, they weighed Anchor again, and leaving <hi>Newburg</hi> coaſted the ſhore as far as <hi>Cartmund.</hi> When they were come near the Town, which is ſeated at the mouth of the River <hi>Carta,</hi> from whence it hath its denomination, and had viewed it well, the place ſeemed very abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, in ſo much that it was unanimouſly reſolved to try their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune there, with hopes of better ſucceſs than at <hi>Newburg.</hi> The Boats therefore were immediately filled with Souldiers, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded towards the ſhore. The <hi>Danes</hi> had the Van, being no leſs ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the honour, than deſirous of performing their own buſineſs: But being they did not advance as faſt as was required, and that the Boats, by reaſon of their loading and the ſhallowneſs, could not move further; Collonel <hi>Killegrew,</hi> Sir <hi>Walter Vane,</hi> (Monſieur <hi>Buat,</hi> who was with the <hi>Danes</hi> in the Vanguard and firſt quitted his Shallop) Sir <hi>John Skelton,</hi> and the reſt in <hi>Killegrew</hi>'s Boat, leapt into the Water, being breaſt-high, and being followed by all the <hi>Netherland Alixiliartes,</hi> made towards Land. The Town gave and received ſeveral Vollies of ſhot as they waded along. Some few <hi>Swediſh</hi> Horſe advanced into the Sea, but were eaſily repelled and beat back. The Cannon from the Ships thundring from all parts inceſſantly upon the Shore, the Bridge, and the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Town, did much facilitate the landing, by forcing the Enemy, unable to reſiſt its violence, to retire. The Town was alſo poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that night, being abandoned by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and the reſt of the Army was landed with all imaginable ſpeed, though much time was ſpent in getting the Horſe on ſhore. <hi>Shack</hi> hearing nothing of <hi>Eberſteyns</hi> advance, continued at <hi>Cartmund</hi> for ſome days, until the Army being fully refreſhed, it was reſolved, they ſhould march towards <hi>Odenſea,</hi> the chief Town of the Iſle, and ſeated in the middle of it: But their motion was but ſlow, by reaſon they had the Enemy in Front, who had alſo poſſeſſed all the Streights and narrow Paſſages in their way.</p>
               <p>The Prince of <hi>Sulsbach</hi> was General of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Forces in the Iſland. His Army was not great, not exceeding five thouſand effective Souldiers (which were encreaſed to that number by the additional Foot which the King had cauſed to be conveyed over by night, to re-inforce his Troops there, when he ſaw it impoſſible to tranſport them out of the Iſland) but it was high in reputation; and yet he could not hinder the Enemies landing at <hi>Cartmund,</hi> or thought it leſs hazardous to fight them afterwards, than to expoſe his men to the certain danger of their Cannon. And yet he was cenſured, becauſe he did not engage either then, or when they were landed, or at any time before their conjunction, though he could not avoid it afterward. His chief care now was, to hinder the uniting
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:104469:64"/>of the two Armies, and therefore he had planted himſelf in thoſe advantageous Streights, betwixt <hi>Cartmund</hi> and <hi>Odenſea.</hi> But hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that <hi>Eberſteyn</hi> was likewiſe landed, contrary to his expectation, and the opinion he had of thoſe Troops which he had ordered to oppoſe him, he changed his mind: for fearing he might be himſelf incloſed betwixt two ſuch powerful adverſaries, he marched with all his Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He had four Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Regiments, as many <hi>Brandenburgers,</hi> ſix hundred <hi>Poliſh</hi> horſe, ſix hundred <hi>Daniſh</hi> Dragoons, and a thouſand horſe of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him. All theſe were wafted over in three dayes and nights time, in thirteen Boats (the Troopers holding and training their Horſes by the bridles, whileſt they ſworn after them) without any oppoſition at all. There were indeed two men of War, and two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther armed Veſſels appointed to meet <hi>Eberſteyn</hi> at <hi>Middlefare,</hi> and alſo to tranſport thoſe troops that were in the Iſlet of <hi>Alſen</hi> into <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,</hi> but being detained by contrary Winds, they were forced to the Iſle of <hi>Aroe,</hi> where they had intelligence of ſome <hi>Swedes</hi> ſhips loaden with prey and ſpoil, that lay in an Inlet by <hi>Alſen,</hi> which they took with their long Boats, and plundered without reſiſtance: the <hi>Swedes</hi> which were in <hi>Middlefare,</hi> and in the Forts and trenches along the ſhore, quitted them contrary to their cuſtom, and the wonted bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of that Nation, at firſt ſight of the Enemy; and leaving above thirty peeces of Cannon behind them, and other warlike proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, retired; leaving an uninterrupted paſſage for the purſuers to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. <hi>Eberſteyn</hi> wondring he had got over ſo eaſily, was afraid the Enemy had laid ſome ambuſh for him, which made him move ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo that he was ſeven dayes in marching ſo many miles to <hi>Oden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea,</hi> where he found <hi>Schack</hi> and <hi>Killegrew,</hi> who had been there three dayes before him, and waited his coming. All the Confederate Forces being now joyned, amounted to near nine thouſand, ſo that ſurmounting the <hi>Swedes</hi> in numbers, they reſolved to go ſearch them out, and give them battle where ever they could find them: there was ſome little diſpute betwixt the two Generals about the precedency. <hi>Eberſteyn</hi> pretended it as eldeſt Field-Marſhal, and <hi>Schack</hi> would not ſubmit, being more immediatly commiſſioned for the preſent expedition. It was therefore agreed, that each ſhould command his own men, and lead the Avantguard by turns. The next day they broke up, and <hi>Eberſteyn</hi> having the Van they marched four miles; the day following they came to <hi>Maſelboom,</hi>

                     <hi>Nov.</hi> 14/29.</note> a mile and a half from <hi>Newburg,</hi> and on the fourteenth, ſaw the Enemy drawn up in Battle-array expecting of them: the Right Wing of the <hi>Swedes</hi> Army, conſiſting of ten Squadrons of Horſe, was lead by the Prince himſelf, four whereof compoſing the Reſerve, being commanded by Major General <hi>Beteker,</hi> one hundred Dragoons clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this Wing on the right hand, and the Front was ſtrengthened
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:104469:65"/>with three peeces of Cannon; the left Wing equalled this in ſtrength and order, conducted by Lieutenant General <hi>Horn,</hi> and the Count of <hi>Waldec:</hi> But the main Body, conſiſting of four Battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Foot, though not exceeding fourteen hundred in all, and five peeces of Ordnance, were commanded by Marſhal <hi>Steynbock,</hi> ſent thither to aſſiſt the young Prince, with his more aged Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels. The <hi>Town</hi> and a Wood, covered the Army behind, ſo that their Rear was ſecure, and a long continued Ditch with ſome wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in it, where the ground was loweſt, interpoſed betwixt their Front, and the larger Campania: there were ſome Avenues in the aforeſaid Ditch, through which the Bodies of Horſe did move, when they engaged on either ſide. <hi>Eberſteyn</hi> ſeeing the Enemies order put alſo his Army into Battalia, Major General <hi>Quast</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Right Wing, conſiſting of the Imperial Regiments, ſome few <hi>Poles,</hi> and a Company of <hi>Daniſh</hi> Dragoons; Count <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Nat,</hi> with his own Regiment and part of Collonel <hi>Mathew</hi>'s, made up the Reſerve: the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Infantry being but two ſmall Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, compoſed the main Battle, being otherwiſe ſtrengthened with fourteen peeces of Cannon; the Left Wing made up of <hi>Brandenburgers, Poles,</hi> one troop of <hi>Eberſteyn</hi>'s Regiment, and a few Dragoons, was encreaſed by five <hi>Dutch</hi> Companies, under the Command of Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Aquila:</hi> the reſt of <hi>Eberſteyn</hi>'s own, and <hi>Konenberg</hi>'s whole Regiment, were appointed for Reſerves. Marſhal <hi>Schack</hi> had by this time alſo put his Army into Battalia, his Right Wing being commanded by Lieutenant General <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feld,</hi> and his left by Major General <hi>Tramp:</hi> the <hi>Netherland</hi> Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries, made up of <hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Companies, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into three Regiments, and lead by their three Collonels, <hi>Kille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grew, Allowa,</hi> and <hi>Metteren,</hi> compoſed the main Battle. <hi>Killegrew</hi> commanded theſe in chief, and the reſt of the Officers, excepting <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowa</hi> who was abſent by ſickneſs, and Sir <hi>Walter Vane,</hi> who wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily diſcharged the Office of Major General, marched with their ſeveral Companies, and in their ſeveral places. Marſhal <hi>Eberſteyn</hi> had choſen the Left Wing, becauſe he would be oppoſite to the Enemies right, which <hi>Shack</hi> obſerving, drew up his troops on his right, ſo that both Armies thus united, made but one, though a very irregular Front, which was occaſioned through <hi>Eberſteyn</hi>'s haſt to engage, and the diſorders which uſually arrive in ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters. The Armies being thus ranged, they met and fought with no leſs deſires than bravery, and the Battle proved doubtful as well as hot, until the <hi>Netherlanders,</hi> the reſt being broken and diſordered, turned the day, by only keeping firm, and ſnatched the Victory out of the <hi>Swedes</hi> hands. <hi>Eberſteyn</hi> had before the Battle began, ſent four hundred Horſe to obſerve the Enemies order and countenance, who advancing too far, were rudely received and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten back to their main Body. In the mean time, the <hi>Eberſtenians</hi> move on, and marching on to the <hi>Swedes</hi> Ditch, endeavoured with great courage to beat them from it, but being as bravely received,
<pb facs="tcp:104469:66"/>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:104469:67"/>they were forced back with great loſs, all the Officers of <hi>Eber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteyns</hi> own Regiment, being either ſlain or wounded. Neither was <hi>Shacks</hi> fortune better, all his Horſe being broken, and routed, ſo that if the <hi>Swedes</hi> had not been hindered by their own Ditch to purſue their advantage at once, by hindering the Enemy to rally behind the <hi>Dutch</hi> Foot, they had infallibly got the Day. <hi>Killegrew</hi> ſeeing the Horſe beaten, marched up in good order to the Ditch, and firing continually by Ranks as he advanced, forced the <hi>Swedes</hi> Foot to quit it, and retire further into the Field behind them. The <hi>Swedes</hi> endeavoured to make head again, but being again diſordered, were charged, broken, and cut in pieces by the <hi>Poliſh</hi> and <hi>Daniſh</hi> Horſe, who were returned to the fight. <hi>Alefeld</hi> had by this rallied his Troops again, and bringing them on a freſh, paſſed alſo the Ditch, and charging the <hi>Swedes</hi> Left Wing of Horſe, routed and purſued them to the Walls of the Town. The Prince having loſt all his Foot, and weakened by the flight of his Left Wing, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no hopes of recovering the Day, retired alſo in reaſonable good order into the City, however purſued by the Victorious Enemy. The Field being cleered, and plundered, and the night growing on apace, the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Generals encamped as near the Town as was poſſible. The next morning; they put they Armies into Battle in ſight of the Enemy, and having planted their Cannon, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a ſudden and general Aſſault, unleſs they ſurrendred. The <hi>Swedes</hi> ſeeing the Enemies preparations, ſent out Commiſſioners to treat with them, and a Trumpeter to <hi>De Ruyter,</hi> who continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally thundred upon them with vollyes of Cannon, to deſire him to deſiſt, for they would deliver up the Town upon reaſonable terms. But all mention of <hi>Conditions</hi> being rejected by the inſulting Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, they were forced to Deliver up themſelves and the Place at diſcretion. Lieutenant General <hi>Horn</hi> marched out with three thouſand Horſe, which as alſo the Priſoners and Colours which had been taken in the Fight, he preſented to the Confederate Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Generals, who divided and diſtributed them amongſt their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Regiments: the Officers, the Town, the ſpoil and all, fell into the Conquerours hands, together with fourſcore Cornets, and eight and twenty Foot-Colours. Amongſt the priſoners of note, were <hi>Horn</hi> himſelf, and the two Major Generals <hi>Weyer</hi> and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Weymer,</hi> and the Count <hi>Koningſmark</hi> had been taken in the Battle the day before; there were alſo ten Collonels beſides the inferiour Officers, and ſome other perſons of quality. The ſlain on the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſide amounted to well nigh two thouſand, beſides Major General <hi>Beteker,</hi> and ſome other leſſer Officers. The <hi>Danes</hi> loſt only their Collonel <hi>Booth,</hi> one Lieutenant Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, one Major, and three Captains of Horſe. <hi>Piazenzewski</hi> the Commander in Chief of the <hi>Poles,</hi> died in this Field of Honour, as alſo Captain <hi>Hemmema</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Friezland,</hi> the only Officer amongſt the <hi>Netherlanders.</hi> The number of the ſlain ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers did not exceed five hundred in all, neither did this ſo ſignal
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:104469:68"/>a Victory and the fruits of it, the Iſland of <hi>Funen,</hi> coſt the <hi>Danes</hi> any more; which ſeemed in ſome ſort, to recompenſe the manifold loſſes they had hitherto ſuſtained. The two <hi>Swediſh</hi> Generals the Prince of <hi>Sulsbach</hi> and Marſhal <hi>Steynbock</hi> eſcaped the danger, for being retired into the Town, and in an impoſſibility of either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the place or being relieved, and ſeeing they had but that one night of reprieve, they thought it more reaſonable to hazard an eſcape, than ſubmit to a certain ſurrender. They therefore expoſed themſelves in a ſmall Boat to the mercy of the Sea, and eſcaped by favour of the darkneſs, and nimbleneſs of their Rowers, through all the Enemies Fleet, and came early the next morning to <hi>Corſeur,</hi> where they in perſon, the only remains of ſo great a Defeat, were the Meſſengers of the Kings loſs, and their own misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> heightened with this ſucceſs, would by all meanes transfer the War into <hi>Zeland,</hi> terrified as they ſuppoſed, with the late loſs. But <hi>De Ruyter</hi> pretending the haſty approach of Winter, the danger of the Ice if it ſhould freeze, and the want of Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his Fleet, refuſed to help them over, and however they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to him that it was but a buſineſs of a few hours, yet he would not be perſwaded to aſſiſt them any further; the States peradventure thinking they had done enough, if they could oblige the <hi>Swedes</hi> to a Peace, not ruine them: for they could not chuſe but remember the <hi>Danes</hi> former exacting upon them in the <hi>Sound,</hi> and the dangerous growth of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> in <hi>Germany.</hi> The Confederate Army was therefore diſperſed into Winter quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>Eberſteyn</hi> returned with his Troops into <hi>Holſtein: Schack</hi> and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Auxiliaries continued in <hi>Funen,</hi> and <hi>De Ruyter</hi> ſailed to <hi>Lubeck,</hi> to re-victual his Fleet. The <hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>Norway,</hi> and the Iſland Fleets, loaden with an immenſe quantity of all ſorts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, arrived at the ſame time in the <hi>Belt;</hi> and joyning with <hi>De Ruyter,</hi> ſailed with him to <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> where he was received with joy by the Citizens, and with much favour by the King, who honoured him with a great Chain of Gold,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dec.</hi> 15.</note> and a Meddal beſet with Diamonds, as a mark of the eſteem his Majeſty had for the ſervice he had rendered him.</p>
               <p>The Mediatours having had notice of what had paſſed in <hi>Funen,</hi> went to <hi>Elzineur,</hi> fancying that the <hi>Swedes</hi> would after ſo great a blow be more inclinable to Peace, but they were deceived; for the King, leſt he might be thought to yield with his misfortune, ſeemed no leſs conſtant now than he had been before; and yet they gained ſo much, that an Act of Redintegration of September twenty nine, was paſſed, whereby all hoſtilities, unkindneſſes, and controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſhould be removed; and the old, ſincere, faithful and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual friendſhip, be renewed and reſtored betwixt the King and States. The <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Elbing</hi> and its elucidations were alſo agreed upon; but with this reſtriction, that the ſaid <hi>Treaty</hi> ſhould not be binding and of force, before the Peace betwixt the <hi>Northern Crowns</hi>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:104469:68"/>were concluded. But before we go further, it will not be from the purpoſe, to give the curious Reader, a ſhort account of this <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Elbing,</hi> being we ſhall have occaſion to mention it ſo often here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and that it will be ſo much inſiſted upon in the following Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative.</p>
               <p>The States General intereſſing themſelves in the Wars of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and apprehending the <hi>Swedes</hi> conqueſts in that Kingdom, had ſent their Embaſſadours into <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> to ſecure their own traffick, and mediate, if poſſible, a peace betwixt them and the <hi>Pole.</hi> Their reception there was not ill, though their entertainment by the way had been but courſe, for they had been detained ſome dayes at <hi>Lowenburg</hi> againſt their wils, though under pretexts of honour, their complaints being only paid with excuſes, and a pretended mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of the Commander, though he had ſhown the Chancellor <hi>Oxenſtern</hi>'s order for what he did. Theſe Embaſſadours were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a great Fleet, under the Command of Admiral <hi>Opdam,</hi> who in order to the League quaranty with <hi>Denmark,</hi> for defence of the Commerce of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, and particularly for the City of <hi>Dantſick,</hi> came and Anchored before the ſaid <hi>Town.</hi> This way of Negotiation produced the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Elbing,</hi> which renewed them of the years 1640, and 1645. confirmed the liberty of traffick without augmenting the impoſitions, and included the City of <hi>Dantſick</hi> with a reſerve of their fidelity to their own Prince. But <hi>Dantſick</hi> waved this incluſion, under pretence of Loyalty to the King and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Poland,</hi> but more truly, becauſe they not only fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an incorporation with <hi>Sweden,</hi> but alſo deſired no Superiour ſtronger at Sea than themſelves, which would infallibly follow, if <hi>Pruſsia</hi> continued in the <hi>Swedes</hi> power: For theſe and other reaſons, diſcovered in the context of this Relation, the whole <hi>Treaty</hi> continued hitherto unratified. But to return from whence we digreſſed, the ſaid <hi>Treaty</hi> being now agreed upon, many priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners on both ſides, were as a teſtimony of their renewed Amity, ſet at liberty, and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadours are now received as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, without any ſcruple or exception. For all this, they could not bring the buſineſs to an abſolute Accommodation, Winter was near, and there was no appearance that the <hi>Swedes</hi> would change quarters in ſo rude a ſeaſon, and therefore the King having left the Command of his Forces and the Iſles, to the Prince of <hi>Sulsbach,</hi> and bid adieu to the Mediators, after he had feaſted them, he paſſed over into <hi>Schonen,</hi> and went thence in haſt to <hi>Gottenburg</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the Aſſembly of the States of <hi>Sweden,</hi> which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to meet him there.</p>
               <p>The Mediators ſeeing the King gone, and perceiving that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would be done in his abſence, returned all to <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> where the time for the moſt part was ſpent in jollity and feaſting. Neither had the Citizens any great cauſe to complain, being abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly furniſhed from <hi>Holland, Iſland, Norway, Jutland, Holſteyn, Lubeck,</hi> and other places of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, with all manner of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:104469:69"/>proviſions. The Souldiers, eſpecially the <hi>Dutch,</hi> both Sea and Land Militia, were furniſhed with ſtockings, ſhoes, ſhirts, and coats, againſt the preſent cold, ſo that the City had rather the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a place that triumphed over their Enemies, than of a beſieged Fortreſs. The <hi>Dutch,</hi> as alſo the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Ships, were all within the Haven in ſurety, being frozen up, in ſo much that the Marriners who ſtill lodged on Board, were forced every day to break the Ice round about them, which ſecured them as well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſurpriſes, as other deſignes of the Enemy. All the Marſhes and Waters about the City were frozen, ſo that the whole Campania was become paſſable and open, which induced many of the Beſiegers to refuge themſelves in the Town, pretending the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferableneſs of the cold, and the hard duty they were put to: King <hi>Frederick</hi> had alſo cauſed Billets to be thrown about the Camp, inviting all ſuch as would come to his ſervice, with promiſe of preſent reward, and good quarters. He likewiſe ordered ten Ryx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dollers to be given to every fugitive Trooper in hand, provided he came with his Horſe and Arms; and five to every Footman that came accoutred; and certainly, if his moneys had held out, the number of theſe Run-aways, which were near an hundred, would have amounted to a far greater. Moſt of theſe fellowes were <hi>Germans,</hi> which obliged the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Generals, to remove all the <hi>German</hi> Regiments and Troops further from the Town, and put <hi>Swedes</hi> and <hi>Fins</hi> in their places, as men of better principles and fidelity.</p>
               <p>The Summer and Fall were paſt, without any remarkable action betwixt the City and Camp, both parties ſeeing no appearance of doing good upon each other; being content to keep within their holds. But the Winter being advanced, and the Ice having render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ways and fields paſſable, they skirmiſhed, attacked, and made ſallies upon each other, with various ſucceſs and fortune. In <hi>November,</hi> the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Horſe fell upon a Guard of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Town and their Camp, which they ſurpriſed, killing and taking above ſixty of them. The Month following, thirty ſtout fellowes of the Garriſon ſlipt out in a Boat, and by favour of the night, landed near the Paper mills, a <hi>Dutch</hi> mile from the City: they hid themſelves in a Wood all the following day, but the darkneſs being come, they went to <hi>Fredericksburg,</hi> a pleaſant and ſumptuous Houſe of the Kings, and breaking open the Stables, took away eight and twenty good horſes, belonging to the King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and mounting them, got ſafe with them, for all the Enemies purſuit, to <hi>Coppenhagen:</hi> the lucky temerity of a Lieutenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the afore-mentioned Fugitives, was no leſs remarkable; who ſtealing out of the Town by night, paſſed all the Enemies ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions undiſcovered, and coming to <hi>Rotſchild,</hi> ſurpriſed the Guards there, and brought ſome twenty Horſe with him back into the Town; theſe ſmall ſucceſſes did much heighten the beſieged, who as it is uſual in ſuch encounters; began to contemn the Enemy, and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:104469:69"/>hope for greater advantages, which they attempted, though not with the like facility, as we ſhall ſee hereafter.</p>
               <p>During theſe doings in <hi>Denmark,</hi> it will not be from the purpoſe to obſerve what happened elſewhere in order to them. King <hi>Charles</hi> was not ignorant how many difficulties, and what great obſtacles the <hi>Netherlanders</hi> had oppoſed to his proceedings, how violently they had acted againſt him, and what further reſiſtance he might expect from them, unleſs they were diverted. He had therefore diſpatched Monſieur <hi>Coyet</hi> his Embaſſadour extraordinary to the States General ſome moneths ſince, to endeavour to remove thoſe jealouſies, which obliged this wary Nation, to intereſt themſelves in the tranſactions of their Neighbours. Whileſt <hi>Coyet</hi> was haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for <hi>Holland</hi> in a <hi>Zeland</hi> States man of War, he had like to have been ſhipwrackt upon the dangerous ſhores of <hi>Anhout,</hi> for his Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel being thrown upon a ridge of Sand by the violence of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, ſtuck there immoveable, ſave its fearful rocking by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocation of thoſe Waves, which threatned its ruine every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Coyet</hi> ſaved himſelf in a Merchant ſhip which accidentally paſſed that way, and many of the Seamen having tied a number of empty Casks together with ropes, changed one danger for another. But the Captain being reſolved to periſh with his ſhip, did yet what he could to ſave both: He threw all his heavieſt Cannon and lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage over-boord, and ſo lightened his Veſſel, that the Wind turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Northwards, it was lift up with the Waters, and ſo got off its unhappy ſtation, and returned contrary to the expectation of all men, back to <hi>Elzineur.</hi> And certainly, ſo brave a man as this Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, whoſe name is <hi>Adrian Bankert,</hi> a <hi>Zealander,</hi> deſerves to be mentioned in our Relation, eſpecially, having ſignalized himſelf once before by ſaving his Ship. It happened, that having the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>watch before the Haven of <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> his Cables being cut in peeces by the Ice, he was carried away with the ſtream and ſholes, as far as the little Iſland of <hi>Ween,</hi> and ſo near the ſhore that he ſtuck faſt in the Sands. The <hi>Swedes</hi> eager of the prey, which they thought aſſured, ſent two men of War and ſeveral armed Boats to ſeize upon him, but finding more reſiſtance than they had imagined, they raiſed a Battery on Land, and ſo attacked him on all ſides at once; but <hi>Bankert</hi> defended himſelf ſo well, that he ſunk the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies fire-ſhip, battered their Battery on ſhore, and treated the reſt ſo rudely, that they were forced to retire, and ſuffer him to get off, which he did in ſafety. <hi>Coyet</hi> notwithſtanding his former dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, went aboard the ſame Ship again, which being repaired, he ſet ſail and arrived in <hi>Holland</hi> in November following. The <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgiſh</hi> Miniſters, did all they could to hinder his Reception and Audience, not forgetting to put the States in mind of the injuries and affronts, which the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had ſo lately done to their Embaſſadours in <hi>Denmark.</hi> But all they could do,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nov.</hi> 25.</note> could not unmask the States ſo far, as to oblige them to declare open War againſt <hi>Sweden,</hi> though they otherwiſe incommodated it
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:104469:70"/>by all the means they could imagine: a publick rupture had not been adviſable, being the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet there, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> nearer home were reaſonably to be apprehended, beſides they thought it below their accuſtomary prudence, only to crack the Shell whileſt their Allies went away with the Kernel; all the Conqueſts they could hope for in thoſe parts, being but a liberty of Commerce, which they were ſurer of, in the diſmembring of the <hi>Sound,</hi> than in a plenary reſtauration of <hi>Denmark</hi> to its priſtine greatneſs, which had formerly ſo much perplexed and troubled their Navigation. Beſides all this, there was anotheer weighty reaſon why <hi>Coyet</hi> ſhould be admitted, which was, to render their Neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity faſter, and their interpoſing leſs ſuſpect: being therefore recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the uſual Ceremonies, and admitted to Audience, he laid before them the ancient Leagues and Confederations betwixt the two Nations, and how religiouſly they had been obſerved on the <hi>Swedes</hi> part, which the preſent King <hi>Charles Cuſtave</hi> had not only ſacredly kept hitherto, but had alſo obliged himſelf by the late <hi>Treaty</hi> at <hi>Ething,</hi> which contained moſt advantagious conditions for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> to do ſo for the future. He could not therefore but won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee, that the ſame was not ratified by them; which the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of ſome men, who preferred their own paſſion and lucre before the good of their Countrey, and hitherto hindered; and how ever he had conſented to an enlarging and explaining of the ſaid <hi>Treaty,</hi> to their own deſire, yet it took no effect; for the States had for all theſe amicable Conceſſions, ſent their Fleet to <hi>Danſick</hi> to thwart his Deſignes in <hi>Poland,</hi> and inſtead of aſſiſting of him againſt the invading <hi>Danes,</hi> with thoſe ſupplies which they were obliged to by their Leagues with him and his Predeceſſours, they did not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to favour the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> in his unjuſt endeavours againſt him. Nay, they had ſo far contemned and rejected his friendſhip, who had ſuffered near a hundred of their Merchant-men, which he had in his power in the <hi>Sound,</hi> to paſs untouched or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted; that they had after the manner of profeſſed Enemies, ſent a Fleet of War to aſſault and oppreſs him. He did therefore ſeriouſly complain of this ill-treating and violation of friendſhip, eſpecially being he had omitted nothing on his part, for the conſervation of a good underſtanding betwixt them, and that they on the contrary, had flown into open acts of violence and hoſtility, without ſo much as trying the wayes of Peace: For all this, the King had ſent him to declare his moſt ſecret intentions to them, to explain thoſe things which their Deputies in <hi>Denmark</hi> had ſcarce order to mention, to endeavour to remove what ever there was of any moment, that might cheriſh thoſe heats and jealouſies which were betwixt them, and to renew thoſe Leagues of Amity, which they had formerly ſo much eſteemed, and which the King, would if they pleaſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes keep inviolably. He further propounded, that Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners might be ordered to treat with him, which was granted, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they moved not ſo quick as he deſired, the main buſineſs

               <p>The King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> hearing of <hi>Coyet</hi>'s being in <hi>Holland,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, leaſt his affairs there might ſuffer, to oppoſe him in kind. He therefore ſent the Lords, <hi>Otto Krage,</hi> and <hi>Gotske Bockwalt,</hi>

They therefore beſought them to continue their aſſiſtance, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the reiterate Leagues betwixt them, and that until <hi>Denmark</hi> were delivered from the oppreſſion of their Enemies. They fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther demanded, that they might not at all be tied to the Treaty of <hi>Rotſchild,</hi> which the <hi>Swedes</hi> had broken, but that the ſaid <hi>Swedes</hi> might be obliged, not only to render what they had uſurped, but alſo to reſtore <hi>Schonen</hi> a dangerous neighbour to <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> in compenſation of the manifold loſſes which they had ſuffered by their violence. Laſtly, they deſired a Peace, but would have it gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as ſecureſt both for their Commerce and their Allies. Some time after, they required that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Militia in <hi>Denmark,</hi> might be made up ſix thouſand effective men, that the States would fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with 24 thouſand Crowns every moneth, and lend them thirty Ships of War as ſoon as the Ice was broken, to be at the Kings command. In lieu of all this, they offered the States <hi>Drontheym</hi> in <hi>Norway, Malmuyen</hi> or <hi>Lanskrown</hi> in <hi>Schonen,</hi> when they were taken, or <hi>Gluckſtat</hi> in <hi>Holſteyn,</hi> as pledges and ſecurity for their moneys.

               <p>The States alſo anſwered <hi>Coyets</hi> expoſtulatory ſpeech, accuſing the <hi>Swedes</hi> as the cauſers of the breach of thoſe Leagues, and that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip they ſo much complained of. Firſt, they put him in mind how Queen <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> had not only refuſed them thoſe Succours during the <hi>Engliſh</hi> War, which the Crown of <hi>Sweden</hi> was obliged to ſend them, but had alſo hindred the tranſport of the Cannon, which they had then bought in <hi>Sweden</hi> for their uſe, and impriſoned ſome of their Merchants, upon unjuſt and frivolous pretences. They fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declared, that their uſage had not been better ſince the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of <hi>Charles Guſtave</hi> the preſent King to the Crown, for that when a Catalogue of thoſe Princes and States which were eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Friends and Confederates to the Kingdom of <hi>Sweden,</hi> had been openly read in the Aſſembly of States, they were omitted, and wholly left out; nay, that this King had, as <hi>Chriſtina</hi> had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when he was preſſed to renew the ancient Alliances betwixt the two States, declared (under pretext of their League with <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi>) that he was not at all obliged to obſerve them. They alſo complained, how the Kings Fleet had exacted extraordinary Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts, from their Subjects in the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, and how their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours had been detained at <hi>Lowenburg</hi> againſt their wills. As for the Treaty of <hi>Elbing,</hi> they acknowledged they had deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a neceſſary Elucidation, not Eluſion of ſome of its Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, the which not being concluded, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the former Treaties betwixt them not to be obligatory, it ſeemed but reaſonable in them to look to their own affairs, and to ſend a Fleet and Souldiers to <hi>Danſick,</hi> as well to ſecure their Trade, as to inſure a City which was their Friend and Confederate. They added, that they were not ignorant with how much induſtry both Queen <hi>Chriſtina</hi> and King <hi>Charles,</hi> had not only endeavoured to ruine the good intelligence which was betwixt King <hi>Frederick</hi> and their State, but had alſo laboured by the acceſſion and aſſiſtance of <hi>Denmark</hi> to exclude them out of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea. But being they
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:104469:71"/>could not compaſs it, it was no wonder if the States General did aſſiſt a Prince who was their Confederate and Friend. And yet they profeſſed, that when the Peace betwixt the two Northern Crowns was once made, they would omit nothing which might conduce to renew and re-eſtabliſh the ancient Alliances and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, betwixt the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and their <hi>United Provinces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During theſe tranſactions, the <hi>Imperialists</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgers</hi> made havock of all in <hi>Pomerania</hi> uncontrouled, under pretext of diverting the <hi>Swedes</hi> in their proceedings in <hi>Denmark.</hi> The War in <hi>Norway</hi> was alſo carried on with much eagerneſs, but with more va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ſucceſs; but being theſe Conteſts happened out of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> however relating to the ſubject in hand, though at a diſtance, I thought good to omit them, as well to avoid prolixity, as to eaſe my ſelf, eſpecially, being the knowledge I had of them was but at ſecond hand. I muſt not however omit to ſay ſomewhat of the death of King <hi>Charles,</hi> he having been the only Author of the Siege we mention, although prevented by his untimely end, from finiſhing that which he had ſo vigorouſly undertaken.</p>
               <p>The Convention at <hi>Gottenburg</hi> being ended, the King who had lain ſome time ſick of a malignant Fever, ſeemed to have overcome the violence of his Diſeaſe; but falling into a relapſe, and percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that he muſt ſubmit to that neceſſity, which impoſes upon Kings as well as meaner perſons; he cauſed his Queen, his Friends, and the Chief Officers of his Crown, to be called to him. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted ſuch as he perceived to mourn his misfortune with moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and having ſpoken to many of them in particular, ſpent the approaching night in ſtrugling againſt the rage and impatience of his malady. He paſſed the following day (as if he had made a truce with death) in ordering his affairs, and now all things being finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he received the bleſſed Sacrament with much devotion, and ſeemingly ſatisfied with the unevitableneſs of his fate, commanded his chief Phiſician, to give him timely notice, ſome hours before he muſt expire. A while after, being warned as he had deſired, he roſe up, and being placed in a Chair at the Table, he cauſed his Will to be produced and read, in the preſence of the Senatours of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Amongſt other Legacies, he had left the Crown to his Son, and appointed his Queen, Regent and Tutreſs during his minority. His Teſtament being read, he demanded if there were any amongſt them, who had any thing to ſay againſt it, but no body anſwering, he ſigned it, as alſo very many other Inſtruments, Orders, Letters, and the like. When there remained nothing more to be done, as if ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with labour, he demanded reſt; but being ſhown his Bed by his Attendants, he replied, that he ſhould dye as ſoon as he entred into it; but added, this alſo muſt be hazarded, manifeſting no leſs courage in his laſt moment, than he had done in the whole courſe of his life. Being therefore laid, he recommended his ſoul to him that gave it, and with a gentle ſigh, expired betwixt the arms of Count <hi>Brake</hi> and <hi>Bidal,</hi> then next him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:104469:72"/>And thus ended <hi>Charles Gustave</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> a Prince for Councel, for Induſtry and for Eloquence; not abſurdly compared to <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> and for greatneſs of mind to his ſon <hi>Alexander.</hi> He had done many brave actions, being yet but a private man, but being come to the Crown, he invaded <hi>Poland,</hi> and having expelled the King, forced all the Orders of that Kingdom to ſwear fealty to him. Being returned, he repreſſed the <hi>Danes,</hi> who had made War upon him in his abſence; and had if he had not been hindred, as we have already related, oppreſſed them altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I am not ignorant, how that not only this brave Princes E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, but many of his friends, did attribute the cauſe of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, and end, to a melancholly which he had contracted for the loſs of his Army in <hi>Funen.</hi> I will not ſay, but this blow was very ſenſible, as being the only material diſgrace which he had yet ſuffered from fortune; but that he ſhould ſink under it, was below ſo vaſt a mind: Neither did he ever ſay or do any thing ſince, that might betray him to ſo great a weakneſs. His reception of the <hi>Palſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi> and <hi>Steynbock</hi> immediately after their defeat, had nothing of harſh in it; and his treating of them afterwards, ſhewed him rather a juſt recompenſer, than a deſpiſer of unfortunate vertue: for he for he continued the one in his Government of <hi>Schonen,</hi> and intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted the other with the Command of his Armies, and the Iſles in <hi>Denmark</hi> in his abſence. I can ſay ſomewhat upon my own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; Upon the Kings return to <hi>Cronenburg</hi> after the Battle, I had the honour to be in the preſence, and being called, his Majeſty asked me what newes there was at <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> and if their joy there for their late Victory was not very great? I anſwered, that they were indeed much heightened with it. His Majeſty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon was pleaſed to tell me the whole manner of the Battle, and what Regiments, and what particular perſons did well: concluding, that no body was a Maſter of Fortune, and that nothing was more caſual than War: but the blow was not great, and not mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repaired, in the ſatisfaction he had, that his men had fought well.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Charls</hi> being thus dead in the flower of his age, for he was but thirty ſeven years and three months old, was much lamented by all ſorts of men. The Souldiers bewailed him not as their General, but as their common Parent. Only the <hi>Swedes</hi> hating his ſeverity; and the continual dangers he engaged them in, ſeemed to grieve leaſt. Beſides, the great ones of the Kingdom did not obſcurely foreſee, that the adminiſtration of the publick affairs, during the Kings minority, and the Regents Government, would of courſe fall into their hands; which did likewiſe happen: For the Senators and Chief Officers having no body to oppoſe or awe them, acted now with more liberty and ſecureneſs. And truly, their Councels were more moderate, for they did now dare to profeſs, that they deſired that Peace which their magnanimous Prince had ſo often rejected. Letters were therefore writ by the Queen, in her Sons
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:104469:72"/>name, and ſubſcribed by all the Senators then preſent, to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators, which witneſſed the ſame: For the young King having in them bemoaned the untimely death of his Father, did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely intimate his deſires for Peace. Upon receipt of theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, The French Embaſſadour, Sir <hi>Robert Honywood,</hi>

The above mentioned Conventions with both Kings, were, that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſhould not exact for the future, any Toll or Impoſition, from any armed or Merchant Ships, either in the <hi>Sound</hi> or <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea. Nor the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> (who was to content himſelf with the old and uſual Taxes) impoſed any new, upon any Veſſel whatſoever, belonging to the Subjects of the 3 a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid States. The Declaration did further intimate, that the King ſatisfied with the juſtice and integrity of the Mediators, did refer all to their induſtry and endeavours; and that he would reſtore to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> ſuch places as ſhould appertain to him by force of the Treaty, after the Peace was concluded and ratified, at that very time which ſhould be prefixed by the Mediators for their evacuation. As for the King of <hi>Poland</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> he did profeſs, that he did willingly conſent that both of them, if they pleaſed, might be included in the Treaty, and that he was ready to compoſe all differences and controverſies which were riſen betwixt himſelf, and either or both of them. The Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators having received this Declaration, addreſs themſelves to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> tell him how far they had proceeded with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party, and deſired he would be pleaſed likewiſe to declare his intention, in order to the hoped Accommodation. But the King abhorring the thoughts of the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> Treaty, delayed his anſwer, which obliged the Mediators to deliver him a Paper, wherein they preſſed him to vouchſafe an Anſwer to their Propoſals, and that without any delay, as he had promiſed by his Declaration of the fifth of <hi>March</hi> new ſtile; urging further, that the leaſt demur would be extreamly prejudicial to his affairs and intereſts, But the King continued in his reſolved ſilence, which obliged the <hi>Dutch</hi> Plenipotentiaries, forced to it by the inceſſant importunities of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, to withdraw their Naval Auxiliaries from his ſervice, which they were the more inclined to do, being it

The reſt of the Navy, excepting only three men of War (ſent with Corn and other Proviſions, under the Command of Captain <hi>Barkel</hi> into <hi>Funen,</hi> for relief of the <hi>Netherland</hi> Troop inquartered there, was ordered to ſhut up the Haven of <hi>Landskrown,</hi> which was ſcarcely yet effected, when the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commiſſioners, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the Supream Military as well as Civil power, ſent their Admiral new Orders, by an Expreſs, to abſtain from further hoſtility againſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> to withdraw his Fleet from before the Haven of <hi>Lanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krown,</hi> and to ſuffer the <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſhips to paſs and repaſs at pleaſure. <hi>De Ruyter</hi> being upon the point to depart, was retarded by King <hi>Fredericks</hi> ſudden and unexpected arrival in the Fleet. His Majeſty haſtened thither with ſome Fire-ſhips, before the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhould quit their ſtation, full of hopes to ruine the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Fleet; and had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſo much from the Admiral, that however preſſed by his Orders to be gone, he did not dare to leave him there alone. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadours being acquainted by <hi>De Ruyter</hi>'s Letters of the Kings reſolution and deſign, and that the <hi>Swedes</hi> made preparation to go to Sea, were at a ſtand. It ſeemed diſhonourable and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming their friendſhip, to abandon the reſolved King, who prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted he would not ſtir thence, till he had put his deſign in execution, and to countermand their Orders, ſeemed to queſtion the ſincerity of their intentions and promiſes. In this ſtreight, they bethought themſelves that the <hi>Swedes</hi> had not as yet given any real aſſurance that they would not diſturb the <hi>Dutch</hi> Navigation and traffick; they therefore ſent new commands to <hi>De Ruyter,</hi> not to ſtir till fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Orders, and in the mean time reſolve to expect the return of one of their Gentlemen, which they had ſent the day before to <hi>Helſingneur</hi> to the <hi>Swedes</hi> Commiſſioners, with their inſtrument of Ceſſation, who was to bring another with him from them of the ſame force and tenour. They day following, they wrote again to the aforeſaid Commiſſioners, aſſuring them, That they would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately recall their Fleet upon the receipt of their Inſtrument of Pacification, and give commands for the future, that no manner of hoſtility ſhould be uſed againſt any of their ſhipping whatſoever. And they proved as good as their words, for the Meſſenger being
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:104469:73"/>returned the ſame Evening with the deſired Inſtrument, and the King being come back to <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> without attempting what he had ſo confidently undertaken, for his Fire-works did not take, they forthwith ſent <hi>De Ruyter</hi> Orders to come away with the Fleet, the which notwithſtanding he could not perform, by reaſon of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Winds and the adverſe ſtream, until the ſecond day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The ſenſe and tenour of the two Inſtruments was in effect the ſame; to wit, a reciprocal promiſe and engagement, that no force or injury ſhould be committed on either ſide, againſt the Ships of War, or Burthen of the other, for the future; and in caſe any ſhould happen before notice could be given to their ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, that all ſuch loſſes ſhould be immediately and fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and repaired. The <hi>Swedes</hi> Commiſſioners, had together with the ſaid Inſtrument, ſent the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadours other Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wherein having magnified their candor, ſincerity and deſires for Peace, they required that the Treaty of <hi>Elbing</hi> might be rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with all ſpeed, and that in the mean time it might begin, and be of force, to all intents as if it were already ratified and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But this being waved for the preſent, the <hi>Dutch</hi> thought it enough to keep to their Ceſſation, and therefore as they had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their Navies not to act, ſo they ſent an Expreſs to Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Killegrew,</hi> their Collonel General in <hi>Funen,</hi> with Inſtructions to keep his Souldiers within the Iſland, and to attempt nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> unleſs firſt provoked by them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commiſſioners in the interim, looking upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> delays but as deluſions, and troubled that the Fleet was not returned according to the firſt Orders, wrote a ſharp Letter to their Embaſſadours, wherein having minded them with what inceſſant endeavours they had ſought for Peace, and how averſe the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was from it, who had not vouchſafed an Anſwer to their equitable and preſſing deſires. They beſought them, that as they had formerly made War by Sea and Land upon the King of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> when he refuſed Peace, they would now, not unmindful of the rules of juſtice, and their re-iterated Engagements, withdraw all their Succours from the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who did at preſent, and had for ſome Moneths abſolutely refuſed the wayes of Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; being therefore that the <hi>Swedes</hi> had abundantly-witneſſed their propenſneſs for Peace, as appeared by their Declaration of the twenty ninth of <hi>February,</hi> and that it was evident that the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> however preſſed by the Mediators, had no ſuch thoughts, but only to gain time by his ſhiftings and delays, which was ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Common-wealth: They required that they would endeavor to force <hi>Denmark</hi> now, as they had done <hi>Sweden</hi> formerly, to accept of Peace, and that they would abſtain from all manner of injurious actions, and hoſtility againſt the <hi>Swedes,</hi> now openly profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their deſires for reſt and quietneſs. They added in caſe they would not, that they ſhould be obliged to declare in the Name of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of <hi>England,</hi> that the <hi>Dutch</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:104469:74"/>had violated the Covenants made betwixt the two Nations, and that it ſhould be lawful for the ſaid Parliament to demand reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all ſuch breaches and unſufferable provocations. But the Fleet having quitted <hi>Lanskrown,</hi> as is mentioned, the Mediators laying aſide theſe altercations for the preſent, repair to the King again, and joyntly entreat him, that he alſo would at length, as the <hi>Swedes</hi> had already done, be pleaſed to give in his Declaration for Peace; which he yet deferted, in expectation of the return of an Expreſs which he had ſent into <hi>Holland;</hi> hoping that the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry and endeavours of his Embaſſadour at the <hi>Hague,</hi> would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the States General to procure him better conditions. In the mean time, he demanded of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſters, what return they did expect for their expences in the War? for it concerned him to know it in time, becauſe thoſe charges, how vaſt ſoever, were to be required from the <hi>Swedes</hi> as the Authors of it, before the Peace ſhould be concluded. But theſe croſs queſtions were but to gain time, whileſt the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Embaſſadours preſſed the States with their ſollicitations at the <hi>Hague.</hi> Amongſt other things, they highly complained, that their Plenipotentiaries in <hi>Denmark,</hi> had upon the bare receipt of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Declaration, raſhly and inconſiderately recalled their Fleet from before <hi>Lanskrown,</hi> and that without ſo much as conſulting their King; which was of ſo miſchievous a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to him, that the <hi>Swedes</hi> by this means let looſe, had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy intercepted many Veſſels belonging to his Subjects, and did dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rove at the Gates of <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> and that in ſight of the States Fleet without controul. They further deſired them to call to mind, the Leagues betwixt both Nations, and thoſe engagements they had made to proſecute the War, until <hi>Denmark</hi> were reſtored to its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine tranquility and condition: They therefore beſought them, that they would deſiſt from that fatal Ceſſation, which had loſt them their Iſlands laſt year, and now the occaſion of ruining the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Fleet in the Haven of <hi>Lanskrown,</hi> with thoſe fire-ſhips they had prepared for that deſign, and command <hi>De Ruyter</hi> to act vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly againſt their Enemies, until they did declare that they would embrace an equitable peace, wherein the <hi>Danes</hi> might find ſecurity for the future, and compenſation for their paſt and preſent ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Neither did theſe complaints of the Embaſſadours prove wholly fruitleſs, being the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Declaration, which made no ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick mention of the <hi>Hagues</hi> Conventions, was not judged ample enough, but more eſpecially, becauſe of the diffidence there was that the effects of it ſhould not ſo ſuddenly follow, as was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
               <p>The States therefore profeſs by their Letters to their Miniſters in <hi>Denmark,</hi> the diſlike of the removal of their Fleet from <hi>Lanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krown,</hi> and the licentious ravaging of the <hi>Swedes</hi> at Sea: adding, that if the Peace were not yet made, and that it ſhould appear that the <hi>Swedes</hi> were the cauſe of this delay, that they ſhould then not only hinder their Naval excurſions, but employ all their Sea and Land
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:104469:74"/>Forces, to compel them to it with all imaginable ſpeed and vigour. And this indeed was the Embaſſadours deſign, before they gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the <hi>Swedes</hi> the above mentioned Ceſſation; to the which they were not only inclined, by the <hi>Swedes</hi> aforeſaid Declaration, but chiefly becauſe the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> did then againſt all expectation manifeſtly refuſe Peace.</p>
               <p>But to return to <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 18.</note> the above-mentioned Meſſenger being arrived, the Mediators were ſent for to Court, where in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the Declaration they did expect, they were demanded by the Kings Order, what change the <hi>Swedes</hi> deſired in the Treaty of <hi>Rotſchild?</hi> To which the <hi>Dutch</hi> anſwered, that the Mediators were not very ſollicitous of that, only deſired to know, whether his Majeſty would be pleaſed alſo to give his Declaration for Peace? Adding, that otherwiſe they ſhould be neceſſitated to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and put in execution the Commands of their Superiours. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many Conteſts to and fro, the King leſt he might ſeem altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther averſe from Peace, did at laſt promiſe, that he would the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing day, deliver the ſo much deſired Declaration, and that in the ſame form that the <hi>Swedes</hi> had given theirs, which he alſo did. During theſe diſputes, the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Commiſſioners had by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadours, preſſed the <hi>Dutch</hi> to a conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Arms with them, by vertue of the Treaty of <hi>Elbing,</hi> the which ought as they pretended, to begin and be of force from that time they had exhibited their Declaration for Peace: but they were anſwered, that that could not be under that pretext, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by vertue of the Treaty made betwixt the three States, which alſo was now needleſs to urge, being affairs were in ſo hopeful a way of being accommodated without coming to thoſe extremities. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadours did moreover complain, that <hi>Coyet</hi> the <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh</hi> Legat at the <hi>Hague,</hi> had endeavoured to bring the ſaid Treaty of <hi>Elbing,</hi> to the teſt again, and ſubject its illuſtrations, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of ſo much ſweat and time, to new and impertinent diſquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But the Kings Declaration ſilenced theſe unſeaſonable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, and now both their Commiſſioners by the intervention of all the Mediators met in the Tents again, and ſeemed to re-aſſume their Treaty with better hopes of ſucceſs than before.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet being retired from <hi>Lanskrown,</hi> they were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by eight <hi>Swediſh</hi> Men of War, who having ſaluted the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, caſt Anchor near him, and began to ſhut up the Haven of <hi>Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penhagen</hi> once more. Hence many Merchants Ships of burthen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ignorant of what had happened were intercepted, and that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Commerce which the beſieged had hitherto freely enjoyed was interrupted. But this miſchief was timely remedied, for the <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadours upon notice hereof, commanded <hi>De Ruyter</hi> not to ſuffer any hoſtility whatſoever within ſight of his Fleet, which he was ſo careful to perform, that when the <hi>Swedes</hi> had ſent three Men of War to lye at <hi>Draker,</hi> he alſo did ſend as many to wait upon them there. The <hi>Swedes</hi> ſeeing themſelves thus obſerved, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:104469:75"/>want of proviſion (and indeed the Treaty advanced but unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly) hoſed ſail again; and returning to <hi>Lanskrown,</hi> came to Anchor at the entry of their Haven, ready there upon all occaſions. The three Ships which were at <hi>Draker,</hi> making towards the Eaſt Sea, fell upon a Galliot coming from <hi>Holſteyn,</hi> which they took, and in it Field-Marſhal <hi>Schack,</hi> and <hi>John Alefeld</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General of the Horſe, both going to <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> being ſent for by the Kings orders. They were carried Priſoners to <hi>Malmuyen,</hi> and being delivered to Marſhal <hi>Steinbock</hi> Governour of <hi>Schonen,</hi> were kept in ſafe cuſtody by his command. Sir <hi>Walter Vane</hi> came with them from <hi>Funen,</hi> but was immediately ſet at liberty without ranſom (the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſuppoſing the Peace betwixt themſelves and the States already concluded) and permitted to continue his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> the Meſſenger of this unhappy accident.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, there was no induſtry omitted to bring the Treaty to a happy iſſue, but being the meetings of the two Kings Commiſſioners, by reaſon of that diſtance and thoſe animoſities which their freſh differences had bred, ſeemed fruitleſs, they were content upon the Mediators preſſing deſires, to give in their ſeveral Propoſitions and Demands by writing, permitting alſo in ſome ſort, the management of their ſeveral Intereſts to their united Arbitrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at leaſt wiſe to their induſtry and endeavours. The Mediators knowing now what they both required, laboured to compoſe an inſtrument which might be acceptable to the one and the other, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating the deſires of the one, to the content and ſatisfaction of the other. After much toil, and time, and conferences, and after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny heats, and diſputes, not only betwixt the Mediators and the Miniſters of both parties, but alſo betwixt the Mediators amongſt themſelves, eſpecially about the compenſation of loſſes, and the remitting of the 400000 Crowns, which the <hi>Swedes</hi> demanded for their <hi>Guiney</hi> dammages, the buſineſs ſeemed fairly advanced, and the Articles were well nigh all agreed to, when an unexpected ſtop was put to theſe proceedings, by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Miniſters, demanding a further explanation upon the <hi>Elueidations</hi> of the Treaty of <hi>Elbing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>May</hi> 3.</note> The difficulty, was about the extent of the defenſive Article compriſed in the ſame: for being that Treaty was to be of force, as ſoon as the Peace betwixt the two Kings ſhould be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> judged it, as it was indeed reaſonable, to clear that point firſt. Before this <hi>remora</hi> could be removed, behold another and no leſs ſurpriſing accident, which did not only diſturb the whole Negotiation, but hurried the Mediators themſelves, but too much diſſenting before, into a manifeſt and open rupture. The States General, being as we have mentioned, not fully ſatisfied with the <hi>Swedes</hi> Declaration, and fancying that the uncontrouled liberty which they had to rove at Sea ſince <hi>De Ruyters</hi> withdrawing from <hi>Lanskrown,</hi> had rendered them leſs inclinable to quietneſs, had by redoubled Orders commanded their Miniſters in <hi>Denmark,</hi> that in caſe the <hi>Swedes</hi> had not already accepted of Peace, according to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:104469:75"/>their Declaration they ſhould (all delayes laid aſide) following the Conventions between the three States, compel them to it by main force. The wary <hi>Swedes</hi> had notice of theſe reſolutions, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the <hi>Dutch</hi> Plenipotentiaries deny their reality when they were interrogated concerning them by the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Commiſſioners, who for all that looked upon them (being they ſeemed too violent) but as fictitious, and publiſhed on purpoſe the better to conceal the true deſign. But the <hi>Dutch</hi> ſeeing their ſecrets (by a miſchief unavoydable in Commonwealths by reaſon of the multitudes of Maſters) diſcovered, acknowledged openly and ingenicuſly that they were indeed the true and real intentions and reſolves of the States, which they would poſitively follow, and execute againſt ſuch who were averſe from Peace. The <hi>Swedes,</hi> as alſo the other Mediators, ſeeing the <hi>Dutch</hi> thus determined, were at a ſtand; for being theſe only were armed, it was ſuppoſed they might dare any thing. This therefore being foreſeen, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> club'd Councels apart, not a little ſollicitous, leaſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> forgetting the limits of Mediation, ſhould render themſelves Umpires and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrators of the whole Negotiation. This jealouſie was much ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened the next day, when as the <hi>Dutch</hi> having framed a new De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign or Project for Peace, however conformable to the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> and <hi>Hagues</hi> Treaties, did not ſtick to deliver the ſame in writing to them. <hi>Terloon</hi> did indeed accept of the Inſtrument, but the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> being it was made without the aſſent of all the Mediators, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely refuſed it, although they ſuffered it to lie upon their Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, being laid and left there by the <hi>Dutch</hi> Plenipotentiaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> being much perplexed at theſe proceedings, bethought how beſt to prevent their progreſs; two dayes after, <hi>Terloon</hi> having largely profeſſed his deſires for an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, preſented an Inſtrument in writing, which the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> had framed, to be aſſented to and ſigned by all the Mediators. The ſum of it was, <hi>That nothing ſhould be done or concluded, or be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, or invalid, in the preſent Negotiation, that was not done by the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous Act and Conſent of all the Mediators, ana being the greateſt difficulties was about the</hi> 400000 <hi>Rixdollars, it was ſubjoyned that that ſhould be referred to the Arbitration of their reſpective ſuperiours them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> perceiving the drift of this Deſign, replied, <hi>That all new Obligations would be ſuperfluous, they being ſufficiently bound by the</hi> Hagues <hi>Treaty, neither could they conſent to their reference concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moneys, being the weight of that burthen would probably fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the</hi> Daniſh <hi>accompt.</hi> The following dayes were for the moſt part ſpent in heats and eager diſputes, and the differences and diffidences grew daily, yea hourly, more and more betwixt them, eſpecially being the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did not ceaſe to move new difficulties about the <hi>Elbing</hi> Treaty. But all theſe conteſts did not ſurpaſs the modeſty of words, nor was there any hoſtility encreaſed betwixt theſe great Diſſenters. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet lay before the Haven of <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> and the <hi>Swedes</hi> had theirs ſecure in that of <hi>Lanskrown. De Ruyter</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:104469:76"/>had indeed Orders to obſerve the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and to oppoſe them with all his might, in caſe they attempted any thing. And it was not long ere this vigilant Commander found an opportunity of acting, for the <hi>Swedes,</hi> notwithſtanding the reiterated warnings given them, fancying nothing leſs than an interruption, and thinking themſelves ſecure, by vertue of their exchanged inſtruments of Ceſſation, and Liberty with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> ſailed out of <hi>Lanskrown</hi> with nine Men of War, one Merchant ſhip, and a ſmall Ketch, and came to Anchor under the Iſland of <hi>Ween,</hi> where they lay two dayes. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadours obſerving this, ſent <hi>Cornelius Everſon</hi> Rear-Admiral of <hi>Zealand,</hi> with ſeven men of War to the <hi>Sound,</hi> to hinder their paſſage through that Streight, in caſe they attempted it. <hi>De Ruy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> continued with ten Ships where he had hitherto lain (the reſt of his Veſſels being ſent into the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea) with a reſolution to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them if they made that way. The <hi>Swedes</hi> being as they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended bound for <hi>Stockholm,</hi> having got a good Wind hoiſed ſail, but being advanced as far as the Shallowes near <hi>Southholm,</hi> their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral received a Letter from <hi>De Ruyter</hi> (which the Embaſſadours had for fear of miſtakes dictated for him, as they alſo had done for <hi>Everſon,</hi> in caſe the <hi>Swedes</hi> had deſigned to paſs the <hi>Sound</hi>) deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to Anchor where he was, for if he ſhould endeavour to paſs further, he was reſolved to oppoſe him, leaſt he might attempt any thing contrary to the tenor of the <hi>Swedes</hi> Declaration, or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the preſent Treaty. The <hi>Swede</hi> amazed with theſe unaccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed commands, and doubtful what to do, was at length forced to ſubmit: for being unequal in ſtrength, though equalin number of Ships, he obeyed <hi>De Ruyters</hi> ſecond ſummons, which was a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Bullet, and letting fall his ſails, after mutual ſalutation came to Anchor. <hi>Cornelius Everſon</hi> who followed the <hi>Swedes,</hi> took his ſtation betwixt them and <hi>Lanskrown,</hi> and the next day <hi>De Ruyter</hi> drawing nearer to them environed them round, to take from them all poſſibility of eſcaping in caſe they attempted it. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours were at the time of detaining the <hi>Swedes</hi> Ships, upon the top of the round Tower at <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> and perceiving the motion of the Fleets, <hi>De Huybert</hi> and <hi>Haren</hi> went forthwith on board <hi>de Ruyter,</hi> to give ſuch Orders as they ſhould judge neceſſary; from whence they likewiſe ſent the <hi>Swedes</hi> Admiral word, that what they had done was to further the Peace, and not out of deſign to prejudice him in the leaſt, which he might be aſſured of. The <hi>Swedes</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were extreamly vexed at the detenſion of their Ships, and complaining bitterly againſt <hi>de Ruyter</hi>'s inſolence, required that they might be ſuffered without delay, to continue their journey to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> whither they were deſigned. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadours fretted yet higher, and accuſing the <hi>Dutch</hi> of breach of Faith, and violation of Covenants, demanded the inſtant relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ships; threatning that in caſe they would not, that they would treat no further with them, but revenge with all their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, thoſe indignities and injuries, which were offered to <hi>England</hi> and
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:104469:76"/>to <hi>France.</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> Embaſſadours replied, that what they had done was but to further the Peace, which if ſeriouſly and ſincerely intended, would be eaſily compaſſed, and leaſt any thing might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervene which might diſturb and interrupt it; in the interim, they only endeavoured to oblige the <hi>Swedes</hi> to put their Declaration in execution. After this,<note place="margin">

They did therefore conjure them, that they would add their endeavours to theirs, according to the ſo often mentioned Conventions, and the inſtructions of their reſpective ſuperiours, in the procuring of a ſudden and ſetled Peace. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> perceiving the <hi>Dutch</hi> had made no mention in their Letters of the detained Ships, fancied they jeered them, and therefore repeated, by moſt bitter reſcriptions, what they had declared before by word of mouth, and ſending expreſſes into <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> acquainted their ſeveral Maſters, and their Maſters Miniſters, with what had hitherto happened in <hi>Denmark.</hi> The Dutch Embaſsadours ſeeing that the other Mediatours had reſolved to treat no more with them, until they firſt releaſed the Ships, did ſend their above ſaid <hi>Project</hi> for Peace to the <hi>Swedes</hi> Commiſſioners, with Letters to the Camp demanding their anſwer. Another Inſtrument of the ſame tenour was delivered to the great Maſter of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and both parties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to accept of thoſe Forms. But the <hi>Swedes</hi> delaying their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, were again preſsed though in vain; for they affirmed, they would not treat any further unleſs their Ships were firſt at liberty. Hereupon the Dutch reſolved to fight the ſaid detained Ships, and to make War upon the <hi>Swedes,</hi> now manifeſtly refuſing Peace, which they alſo had done, if the Danes themſelves fearing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of their miſery, and the perpetuity of theſe deſtroying conteſts had not diſſwaded them from it. In the mean time, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadours had daily conferences with the <hi>Swedes</hi> in their Tents and Camp, and did mainly endeavour to make up a Peace betwixt the two Kings without the Dutch. But the Danes were not to be ſeparated from their Deliverers; neither would the <hi>Swedes</hi> however irritated againſt the Dutch, conclude entirely without them. But ſo much was effected, that both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms were more deſirous of Peace, and their Miniſters now at more liberty and freedom, by reaſon of the diſſentions of the imperious Mediatours, endeavoured the compoſing of it more than ever. And finding themſelves well nigh at their own diſpoſal, and unconſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they urged the buſineſs with more fervour than before; and advanced ſo far, that they agreed upon all the Articles of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, except only on the term to be deſigned for the withdrawing of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Troops, and Garriſons out of the Countrey. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:104469:77"/>the <hi>Swedes</hi> Commiſſioners compoſed an Inſtrument of Pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, according to their Conventions with the <hi>Danes,</hi> and ſent it into the City,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>May</hi> 15</note> which being examined, was not only found to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drate with the <hi>Hagues</hi> Treaties, and the above mentioned <hi>Projects</hi> for Peace, but alſo to contain ſeveral more advantageous conditions for <hi>Denmark,</hi> than they did hope for. The chief controverted points were about the remiſſion of the 400000 Crowns, the reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Iſland of <hi>Bornholm,</hi> and the poſſeſſions of the Gentry and Nobilities goods in <hi>Schonen;</hi> all which were concluded as the <hi>Danes</hi> deſired, for the aforeſaid ſum was abſolutely remitted; the Goods and Lands were reſtored to their true owners; and the Iſland was left in the King of <hi>Denmarks</hi> poſſeſſion for a whole year, with power to redeem it for its value, by exchange or otherwiſe, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it at the expiration of the ſaid time. The <hi>Treaty</hi> being thus far advanced without the Mediators, the King leſt they might ſeem neglected, ſent for the four <hi>Dutch</hi> Deputies to Court, where the <hi>Ryx-hoff-maſter</hi> in preſence of his Majeſty and Senators, told them, that they had agreed with the <hi>Swedes</hi> to the content of both parties, except only the time of evacuation, or clearing the Country of the Souldiers. The Embaſſadours having congratulated his Majeſty hereupon, congratulated alſo the <hi>Swedes</hi> Commiſſioners by Letters upon the happy progreſs of affairs, and invited them, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſiniſter interpretations of ſome men, meaning the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> to the ſanction of the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Elbing,</hi> the which, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with its Illuſtrations, they deſired might be forthwith ratified and confirmed. Some few dayes after, not only theſe Demands of the <hi>Dutch</hi> were aſſented to, but all other differences and deſires ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated, and concluded by conſent of both Kings, and all the Mediators; ſo that the detained Ships were thereupon leſt to their liberty, and by <hi>De Ruyter</hi>'s removal from them, permitted to ſail whither they pleaſed, which did not happen without the congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory thunder of the Cannon on both ſides.</p>
               <p>During this <hi>Treaty</hi> for Peace, the thoughts of War were not ſo laid aſide, but that ſeveral encounters and light skirmiſhes happened betwixt the City and Camp Militia. The beſieged heightened with their former ſucceſſes, thought of attempting ſomewhat more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and therefore ſallying out by night with all their Horſe, fell upon the Enemies Stations or Poſts with the ſame confidence,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.</note> though not with the ſame ſucceſs, as they had formerly done; for the <hi>Swedes</hi> having notice of their deſigns, and ready, received and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them ſo rudely, that they forced them to ſave themſelves by flight within their Works, five of their men being taken priſoners, and ſeveral of them ſlain. The following Month they made another attempt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apr.</hi> 28.</note> but with no better fortune, for they were repelled in the Kings preſence, and loſt threeſcore foot which they had taken with them to ſtrengthen their Horſe. The <hi>Swedes</hi> alſo had deſigned the ſurpriſing of the City Cattle which fed under the Walls,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>May</hi> 17.</note> to which purpoſe they haſtened thither with all their Horſe; but their intent
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:104469:77"/>being likewiſe known, the Cattle were ſecured, and the Enemy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Cannon from the Ramparts to keep at a diſtance. They yet returned ſome dayes after with a thouſand Horſe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>May</hi> 21</note> and threw down a Breaſt-work not far from the ruined Suburbs on the Weſt ſide of the Town, which annoyed them, the which was again raiſed by the <hi>Coppenhageners</hi> two dayes after. The <hi>Sweaes</hi> were alſo buſie in other parts of the Kingdom, for having gathered ſome ſmall Veſſels upon the Coaſts of <hi>Holsteyn,</hi> they landed by <hi>Nyſted,</hi> but being repelled thence, they reſolved to try their fortune on the Iſle of <hi>Fameren,</hi> though not with better ſucceſs, for the Danes having retired their Troops into a ſtrong double Ditched Fort which they had there, contained themſelves in it, until they were re-inforced by freſh ſupplies out of <hi>Holſteyn,</hi> which obliged the Enemy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to their Ships again.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Denmark</hi> was not alone the ſtage of War, neither was it here only that the treaties for Peace were in agitation. <hi>Poland,</hi> the ſeat of ſo many miſeries, was at length delivered from the oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their infeſting Enemies, by the Treaty of <hi>Oliva.</hi> This Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was chiefly managed by the <hi>French,</hi> their Embaſſadour being the only Mediator admitted in it. The Dutch had indeed ſent an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Deputy</hi> to the <hi>Poliſh Court,</hi> but he was received there without Ceremony, ſcarce civility, upon pretext they were not acquainted with his Character, it being a new thing with them. His Mediation was likewiſe waved, the <hi>French</hi> influence (the Queen being Aſcendant) being too ſtrong, and the jealouſies which they began to entertain of the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> not a little formed. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was he more acceptable to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> his viſit to their Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiaries, being but repayed by a complement by their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, upon pretence he was lodged in <hi>Dantſick</hi> an Enemies Town; and his interpoſition wholly refuſed, being looked upon as a party, ſo that he was but an idle Spectator, as to the main in the ſaid <hi>Treaty.</hi> But for all the <hi>States</hi> excluſion, the Emperour and the Electour of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> were not only included in the ſaid Pacification, but the old Friendſhip and Concord renewed, by a new Act of Oblivion, betwixt them and <hi>Sweden.</hi> Only King <hi>Frederick</hi> for whoſe ſake they had armed, (their own buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now done) ſeemed forgot in that <hi>Treaty,</hi> the Commiſſioners giving this reaſon for it, that the <hi>Daniſh</hi> affairs could not commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly be decided at that diſtance, being alſo at that time treated in <hi>Denmark</hi> it ſelf, not without great hopes of ſucceſs. But the Danes troubled to be thus abandoned by their Allies, were ſo much the more deſirous of Peace. They were indeed ſupported at preſent by the Forces of the <hi>United Provinces,</hi> and with hopes out of <hi>England</hi> of more powerful Succours, the Scene being there changed by the happy reſtitution of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, to his hereditary Dominions. This great Princes reſtauration did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed contribute much to the preſent reconciliation, for the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Commiſſioners fore-ſeeing their authority would quickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and loth to quit their Province without effecting what they
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:104469:78"/>came for, urged it; the <hi>Swedes</hi> conſidering the ties of blood and friendſhip betwixt the two Kings, <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Frederick,</hi> did deſire it. And truly the ſame reaſon prevailed with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> but upon another accompt, to wit, leſt they ſhould be preſſed by this great King to continue the War, until <hi>Frederick</hi> his Friend and oppreſſed were reſtored to his entire Dominions, which the victorious <hi>Swedes</hi> had ſo miſerably mutilated. Only the Danes, the only ſufferers, were thought not ſo forward, eſpecially being obliged by this ſecond <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> once more to quit all their pretenſions which they had ſo laviſhly diveſted themſelves of in the former War. But they fore-ſeeing that the ayds from <hi>England,</hi> the King being not yet fully eſtabliſhed in his Kingdoms, could not be ſudden; and that the vaſt expences which they were daily at in feeding ſo many Armies within their Country, would neceſſarily ruine it; ſeemed to prefer a certain Peace before the uncertainties of a War. All parties being then agreed, and that happy day, which by a hopeful Peace was to put a period to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy War being come, the two Kings Commiſſioners and all the Mediators (if they may be properly called ſo, who ſeemed intereſſed asperties) met in the Tents again, where the <hi>Treaty</hi> elaborated with ſo much induſtry and pains, was ſigned; firſt by the Mediators, and afterwards by the Commiſſioners of the two Kings; and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed and delivered in the mid way betwixt the Daniſh lodges and the Swediſh Tents, by the Mediators themſelves, a little before Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſet, to the Commiſſioners of both Kings. This being done, the Aſſembly broke up, the Swedes returning to their Camp, and the Danes into the City; where both from their Walls, as alſo from their Fleets which lay before the Town, witneſſed their joy for this happy Accommodation, with the more pleaſing noiſes of their great and ſmall ſhot. The Peace was proclaimed the ſame night in all the publick places of the City, by a Herald with his Scepter and Coat of Arms, with the tintamar of Drums and Trumpets, whileſt every individual publiſhed his ſatisfaction with more than uſual ſignes of joy. The following dayes the <hi>Swedes</hi> came into the <hi>Town,</hi> and the <hi>Danes</hi> went into the Camp without exception, neither ſatisfying their greedy eyes, and their curioſities with the contemplation of thoſe unaccuſtomed ſights, whileſt both admired, and ſecretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned thoſe things which they had found by experience to have been hurtful to them. But this entercourſe did not laſt long, for the fourth day after the ſigning of the Peace, the Prince of <hi>Sulsbach</hi> did according to the Articles of the <hi>Treaty,</hi> draw all his Forces, which were 3000 Horſe and Foot out of the Camp, and putting them into Battle array betwixt that and the City, made a ſtand there, expoſing his Army and himſelf to the view of the <hi>Danes,</hi> who flocked thither in multitudes to ſee ſo goodly a ſight. A while after having comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his Cannon, and all the Muskets and Piſtols of his Army to fire twice round, he left the City to its priſtine Liberty, and the Camp to the <hi>Danes</hi> diſpoſal, and marched with his whole Army towards <hi>Rotſchild.</hi>

That it may alſo appear that His Majeſty of <hi>Sweden</hi> out of His ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular grace and indulgence, had rather better than diminiſh the condition of His Subjects, it is promiſed, That all the Nobles that will wholly ſubject themſelves to the King and Kingdom of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> as for their perſons, they ſhall enjoy all thoſe Prerogatives and Priviledges, that the Subjects and Nobles of <hi>Sweden</hi> do enjoy, to wit, they ſhall be capable of being received and admitted into the Order of Knighthood, of the Nobles of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and may enjoy equally with them, the right of Voting, according to the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Court of Knighthood; and that alſo ſo, that as many of the Nobles, who can prove that themſelves or their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtours did enjoy the Office of a Senatour in the Kingdom of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> may alſo be aſſured to be honoured with the Prerogative of being received into the ſecond Claſſis of the Knightly Order of <hi>Sweden.</hi> The reſt alſo may be received according to the Ordinance of the Court of Knighthood, and ſhall abſolutely be demeed for Nobles of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and ſhall, provided they render themſelves ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104469:80"/>enjoy the ſame acceſs and admiſſion to Benefices and Honours as the other Nobles of <hi>Sweden.</hi> His Majeſty of <hi>Sweden</hi> doth likewiſe promiſe, that he will be no leſs careful in conſerving the conditions priviledges &amp; liberties of the others Orders in theſe ſurrendred Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and provided they perſevere in their duty to His Majeſty of <hi>Sweden,</hi> they may entertain an aſſured hope of bettering their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditons, and enjoying the ſame Rights as the Natives of <hi>Sweden,</hi> for the acquiring of Offices and Advancement.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. That all the Inhabitants, of what quality ſoever, none excepted, whether in <hi>Schonen</hi> or in <hi>Denmark,</hi> or in <hi>Norway,</hi> who have goods and properties in <hi>Schonen, Halland, Bleking, Bahuys,</hi> and the reſt of the ſurrendred Provinces and Towns, may enjoy them again, and retain them, together with all the moveables or immoveables which are found there, and that they take poſſeſsion of them, the next Feaſt of St. <hi>John,</hi> together with all the priviledges, proprieties and rights, in like manner as had been agreed upon, and concluded in the Treaty of <hi>Rotſchild,</hi> and afterwards encreaſed and bettered by His Majeſty of <hi>Sweaen,</hi> and all without any revenge or loſs for any thing done by any whatſoever, in the late War; provided not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, that wary and moderate Commiſſioners be conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on both ſides, who may deal amicably betwixt both parties, evenning and liquidating their accounts to the full ſatisfaction of each one, the better to prevent all differences in their beginnings which might obſtruct this wiſhed for Peace.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. It is likewiſe conſented to on both ſides, that when the Fortreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are delivered to the King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s Commiſsioners, then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo all the Documents and Inſtructions concerning the Condition, Revenues, Rents, Borders, Shores, and Limits, and alſo thoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which concern the Adminiſtration of Juſtice, Books of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, and others, which may relate to the knowledge of theſe things ſhall be delivered, in caſe any ſuch be found, which are not as yet given over. This done, two or three Plenipotentiaries ſhall be appointed on both ſides, with power to ſeparate, review, direct, and ordain, all the limits and borders betwixt the ſurrendred and their neighbouring Provinces and Governments, where they are not as yet reviewed, ſeparated, directed and ordained, whereby all controverſies and differences may be the better declined, and every one enjoy that which is his, in peace and quietneſs.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. On the other ſide, the King his Succeſſors and Kingdom of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> do yield to the King his ſucceſſors and the kingdom of <hi>Denmark,</hi> all thoſe rights and pretenſions which his Majeſty of <hi>Sweden</hi> may have upon all the Fortreſſes, Fortifications, Iſles, Provinces, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Territories, which he maſtered by force of his armes, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Zeland, Laland, Falſter, Meun,</hi> with all the Caſtles and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleſſes in them, as <hi>Nykoping, Naskow, Cooſter, Corſeur, Keuk</hi> and
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:104469:81"/>
               <hi>Cronenburg,</hi> as alſo all other Cities, Caſtles, Forts, Governments, Gentlemens Houſes, and Territories whatſoever, which are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly excepted in this tranſaction, or not ſurrendred by former Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants. And after they ſhall be rendered and reſtored, with all their appurtenances and rights, according to the tenour of this Treaty, they ſhall follow and belong to the King his Succeſſors and Kingdom of <hi>Denmark,</hi> without any impediment what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. And for the better eſtabliſhing of mutual confidence and Amity betwixt theſe two Kingdoms, His Majeſty and Kingdom of <hi>Sweden,</hi> will have no refuſion for his expences, in thoſe Fortifications which he raiſed in <hi>Denmark,</hi> but wil at the time of their evacuation, take care that they be all delivered intire, and in the ſtate they are now in, to His Majeſty and the Kingdom of <hi>Denmark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">XVII. In like manner, at the inſtance of the Mediators, and for the love of Peace, the Pallace and Government of <hi>Drontheym,</hi> or — together with all its ſubject Cities, Towns, Caſtles and Fortreſſes, as alſo all their Eccleſiaſtical and Secular goods, Governments, and appurtenances, as they were delivered to His Majeſty of <hi>Sweden,</hi> by the Treaty of <hi>Rotſchild,</hi> ſhall be reſtored to the King, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Crown of <hi>Denmark,</hi> to be re-annexed to the Kingdom of <hi>Norway</hi> for ever, without any reſerve of pretenſion upon the ſame to the King, his Succeſſors and Kingdom of <hi>Sweden;</hi> to which end, the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s Letters of Ceſsion made according to the ſixt Article of the Treaty of <hi>Rotſchild,</hi> ſhall be reſtored and cancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. In like manner, the Kings Majeſty ſurrenders for Himſelf, His Succeſſors, and the Kingdom of <hi>Sweden,</hi> all the rights and pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he had or ſhall have, as Duke of <hi>Bremen,</hi> upon the County of <hi>Delmenhorſt</hi> and <hi>Ditmarſh,</hi> and transfers thoſe his rights over to His Majeſty of <hi>Denmark,</hi> his Succeſſors, and the Dukes of <hi>Holſteyn</hi> of the Royal and <hi>Gottorp</hi>'s Line, ſo that His Majeſty of <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> and his Succeſſors, neither will, nor ought, either <hi>de jure,</hi> or <hi>de facto,</hi> ever to pretend any thing more upon theſe Countries. If alſo His Majeſty of <hi>Sweden</hi> obtained any pretenſion, as Duke of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> heretofore, upon ſome Noblemens goods in <hi>Holſteyn,</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is remitted, by vertue of this Treaty, and promiſe made that the documents which are to be found, and pertain hereunto. ſhall be delivered to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the Houſe of <hi>Holſteyn</hi> of the Royal and <hi>Gottorp</hi> Line.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. And that this renewed Friendſhip, may be laid upon a more firm foundation, the King and Kingdom of <hi>Sweden</hi> will let fall and remit, as they do hereby let fall and remit,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:104469:81"/>that Right which His Majeſty, or any of his ſubjects, pretend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the four Tun of Gold for the <hi>Guiney</hi> buſineſs, ſo that hencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nothing ſhall be demanded or required for that ſum, but the King and kingdom of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſhall remain wholly acquitted and free from any payment, or leaſt pretence thereof.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. As alſo the Fortreſſes, as well thoſe which have been taken in this War, as thoſe which are ſurrendred by this Pacification, ſhall be delivered without Cannon, Carriages, or warlike Ammunition on both ſides; except the Caſtle of <hi>Cronenburg,</hi> where according to agreement, thoſe Cannon which were not brought thither by the <hi>Swedes,</hi> or have no <hi>Swediſh</hi> Armes or Inſcriptions upon them, ſhall be retained: So it is likewiſe agreed, that the Country people of thoſe Governments, where thoſe Fortreſſes are ſeated, ſhall be obliged to carry the Cannon and munitions of War to the Shore, where they may be moſt commodiouſly ſhipped and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. It is alſo concluded and promiſed, that in thoſe Fortreſſes which are to be ſurrendred on either ſide, there ſhall be a certain time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, wherein he who ſo ſurrenders a fortified place, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and keep his Ammunition of War which is at preſent there, until he may commodiouſly tranſport it elſewhere.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. All Captives, of what condition ſoever, ſhall immediately be ſet at liberty without Ranſom: But as for their Diet, they ſhall ſatisfie that according to equity. In like manner all <hi>Daniſh</hi> ſubjects which the King and kingdom of <hi>Sweden</hi> cauſed to be tranſported into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places of their obedience whatſoever, may have free and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hindred liberty, to return again into their Native Countries. Such Priſoners who have taken up Arms under the <hi>Danes</hi> ſhall have liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to return to their former Militia, as alſo ſuch who are in the <hi>Swedes</hi> ſervice, if they pleaſe, provided it be done within three Months after the Ratification of this Peace.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. It is alſo agreed, that the places taken by either King, ſince the Peace of <hi>Rotſchild,</hi> ought by force of this Treaty be reſtored to that party, whoſe they were, or ought to have been by the Treaty of <hi>Rotſchild,</hi> and all the <hi>Swediſh</hi> forces, Horſe and Foot, ſhall be withdrawn out of all the Kingdoms, Provinces, Dutchies, and Lands belonging to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> within 14 dayes at moſt after the ratification of this Treaty, which ought to be within a Month after the concluſion of the Peace; in this manner, that as ſoon as the Peace is ſubſcribed, and the ſame day that it is publiſhed, the Siege before <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> ſhall be raiſed, ſo that the Camp ſhall be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:104469:82"/>evacuated within the four following dayes, and <hi>Nyc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Eight dayes after <hi>Naſcow</hi> ſhall be ſurrendred to the <hi>Danes,</hi> and about that time, as ſoon as Shipping is ready and at hand, the withdrawing of the Forces ſhall Commence; eight dayes after this, <hi>Koeg</hi> or <hi>Keuk</hi> ſhall be ſurrendred, and the Souldiers drawn out of it, as ſoon as the Ratifications are exchanged, within the Month after the ſigning of the Peace, and that the ſhipping for tranſporting the ſouldiery are ready; within the four following dayes <hi>Corſeur</hi> ſhall be delivered up, and the Souldiery begin to be imbarked and tranſported, and at the ſame time the Duke of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteyn</hi>'s Country ſhall be freed from all His Majeſtie of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s ſouldiers. Shortly after, the forces which remain, Horſe and Foot ſhall imbark in convenient Havens, and likewiſe be withdrawn from <hi>Cronenburg,</hi> ſo that that Fortreſs ſhall be wholly evacuated and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred the 15 day after the exchange of the Ratifications, or when the ſix Weeks after the concluſion of the Peace are expired, and at that very time all <hi>Zeland</hi> ſhall be delivered and cleared from the <hi>Swediſh</hi> ſouldiers.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. And that no force or injury be done during the ſaid term, to the inhabitants, in the changes of Fortreſſes and withdrawing of ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, out of the Cities and Provinces, but that all things may be done in order, Commiſſioners from both ſides ſhall be preſent, who ſhall both in the Towns and Ports take ſpecial care, that no force, direption of goods, or injuries be done to the Subjects, or any other unlawful thing impoſed upon them, under pain of puniſhment to be inflicted upon the tranſgreſſour. And as it is neceſſary that proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be made for the ſuſtentation of the <hi>Swediſh</hi> forces during their ſtay in the Country, but ſo, that after the day of concluding the Peace, nothing more ſhall be demanded from the ſubjects, under pretext of Redemption, or any other burthens whatſoever, but only what is needful for their ſubſiſtence whileſt they ſtay in this Kingdom, and which ſhall be adjudged ſuch, according to an appointment made by the Commiſſioners of both ſides; and that the evacuation may the ſooner and better be effected. His Majeſty of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſhall forthwith command, in all convenient Havens in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Province, that Ships, Veſſels, and Boats, with their neceſſaries, Men, Mariners, and implements, be gathered together and in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, as His Majeſty will alſo command, whereby the tranſport of the ſouldiery, and the evacuation of places may be haſtened, and not impeded, unleſs by contrary Winds. And all the Ships, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Marriners and men, and what ever elſe, ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by <hi>Denmark</hi> for the ſaid evacuation, ſhall as ſoon as the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port is done, be releaſed without any let or hinderance.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV. It ſhall alſo be free for all the ſubjects and inhabitants of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:104469:82"/>Regions and Provinces, to tranſport themſelves into any other Cities or place to dwell there, provided it be done according to the Statutes of the Provinces and priviledges of the Cities out of which they will tranſmigrate: what concerns the goods which in the time of War were carried into Cities for their ſecurity, the Maſters and Owners thereof may redemand them, without contradiction and impediment.</p>
            <p n="26">XXVI. The former tranſactions and Covenants, to wit, thoſe of <hi>Stetin, Siôder, Bromsbro,</hi> and <hi>Rotſchild</hi> (excepting the third Article, which is plainly excluded here) made betwixt theſe Noble Kingdoms, ſhall retain their force and vigour in all their Articles, and ſhall be confirmed as they were before the beginning of this War, and as if they were inſerted word for word in this Treaty, unleſs in as much as they are expreſly changed in this.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. Whereas it is provided by the 22 Article of the Treaty of <hi>Rotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child,</hi> that His Majeſty of <hi>Denmark</hi> ſhall be obliged according to equity, to ſatisfie his Highneſs the Prince of <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Holsteyn Gottorp,</hi> after that the Commiſſioners of both parts, as well of the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s, as of his ſaid Highneſs have treated, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, and concluded of the matter in difference at <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> the 22 of <hi>May</hi> 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>8. it is agreed by theſe, that all thoſe Covenants and tranſactions ſhall be exactly obſerved and faithfully performed in every particular.</p>
            <p n="28">XXVIII. Moreover, if any thing ſhould have happened in this or the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer War, that might breed any enmities or diffidence, betwixt the King and kingdom of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Holſteyn Gottorp,</hi> as well betwixt themſelves, as their Miniſters, ſervants, and ſubjects, all that, as well out of conſideration of their mutual conſanguinity, and eſpecially of Her Majeſty the Queen of <hi>Sweden,</hi> as betwixt the two Royal, and Ducal Houſe of <hi>Holſteyn Gottorp,</hi> ſhall from this day, by vertue of this Treaty, be compoſed and wholly forgot; and on the contrary, a perfect, ſolid, and perpetual friendſhip be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed betwixt them. His Majeſty of <hi>Denmark</hi> will alſo when the evacuation is made in <hi>Denmark,</hi> withdraw his Army and forces out of his Highneſs Countries, Fortreſſes, and Cities, and alſo uſe his utmoſt endeavour to perſwade the Confederates to evacuate ſuch of his Highneſs Forts and Towns which they poſſeſs, without any delay.</p>
            <p n="29">XXIX. What Kings, Commonwealths, Powers, and Princes ſoever, ſhall deſire to be comprehended in this Peace, muſt require it of both Kings. But the Emperour, the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> together with their Kingdoms, Electorſhips, Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, and Provinces are expreſly included herein. So that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:104469:83"/>and Kingdom of <hi>Sweden,</hi> will ſeek no pretence, under no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text whatſoever, againſt the aforementioned Emperour, King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and Electour of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> becauſe of the ayd given by them this War, againſt the Kingdom of <hi>Sweden</hi> and its Confederats.</p>
            <p n="30">XXX. The Lord <hi>Anthony Gunther</hi> Earl of <hi>Oldenburg</hi> and <hi>Delmenhorſt, &amp;c.</hi> his Succeſſors, Feudals, and Free-holders, together with their Countries, Dynaſties, Lands, Goods, Jurisdictions and Appurte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, ſhall be included in this Pacification; wherein alſo <hi>John</hi> Prince of <hi>Anhalt,</hi> of the Line of <hi>Zerveſt,</hi> becauſe of the Dynaſty of <hi>Jeveren,</hi> and the Lord the Earl <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Oldenburg,</hi> Lord in <hi>Varel</hi> and <hi>Kniphawſen,</hi> with his Dynaſties, Lordſhips, Goods and Rights, ſhall be alſo comprehended.</p>
            <p n="31">XXXI. It is further agreed, that all the Cities comprehended in the <hi>Hanſe</hi> League, none excepted, are likewiſe included in this, ſo that they may enjoy a free and undiſturbed Commerce, in both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, both by Sea and Land: and if any thing have happened in this War, that might offend either party, that alſo is forgot and buried in eternal Oblivion.</p>
            <p n="32">XXXII. And whereas certain ſecret Articles were concluded about the time of the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> Pacification, which are not reiterated in this, all ſuch ſhall be of force, as if they were inſerted word for word in this Treaty. Moreover, what Writings ſoever have been publiſhed during this War, on either ſide, tending to the prejudice or ſcandal of the other, are hereby wholly taken away, and ſhall be caſhiered and prohibited, and be no more divulged or reprinted, within theſe Kingdoms.</p>
            <p n="33">XXXIII. But that all theſe things as they are ſet down, as well in word as in deed, may be obſerved and fulfilled now and for the future, with all firmneſs, fidelity, and ſincerity, it is mutually promiſed that theſe our Covenants ſhall be amicably confirmed by both Kings, <hi>Frederick</hi> the third King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> with the ſubſcriptions of their Hands, and impreſſion of their Seals; and for greater ſecurity, they ſhall be ſigned and ſealed by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours of both Kingdoms.</p>
            <p n="34">XXXIV. It is alſo concluded and promiſed, that a Senator and Secretary of both ſides, ſhall about the 24 of <hi>June</hi> next following meet at <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeneur,</hi> and bring with them and exchange the Ratification of this Treaty, confirmed with the Subſcriptions and Signatures of both parties.

Betwixt the two Crowns of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> under the Mediation of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> to the ſeeming good contentment of both the Kings: The one gaining eminent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, by the acquiſition of a new Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; The other, avoiding the imminent peril of the loſs of his whole Country; I was reman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded out of <hi>Denmark,</hi> by expreſs order from <hi>England,</hi> and placed with His Majeſty of <hi>Sweden,</hi> with intention to begin a new Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, betwixt Him, the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg,</hi> and had powers and creditives requiſite for that purpoſe. In the mean time, new and unexpected jealouſies aroſe, betwixt <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> which at laſt broke forth to an open rupture of the Peace ſo lately eſtabliſhed. The beginning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1658. His Majeſty of <hi>Sweden</hi> rendezvouz'd a Body of his Army at <hi>Kiel</hi> in <hi>Holſteyn,</hi> and there embarqu'd them, but kept his Deſign very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. He propounded to me to go along with him, which I refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, conſidering that his Deſign muſt either be upon <hi>Denmark</hi> or <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> in neither of which caſes it could be proper for me to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Him. Not into <hi>Denmark,</hi> for there I had been already Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and therefore incongruous for me, to have been the Spectator of a breach of the Peace I had ſo lately concluded, without having orders from <hi>England</hi> ſuitable to ſuch an emergency. Not into <hi>Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> becauſe thither I was deſigned Mediator, and therefore ought not to make my ſelf a party, by putting my ſelf in company of an Enemy. Whereupon I ſtopp'd in <hi>Germany,</hi> writing immediately into <hi>England,</hi> to communicate what had paſſed, and attending fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Orders.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:104469:85"/>During theſe traverſes, the old Protector fell ſick, and incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of making reflection upon affairs in thoſe quarters; and ſoon after died. But as ſoon as I had received new Orders and Creditives from <hi>England,</hi> I embarqued at <hi>Travemond</hi> and returned for <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> in queſt of His Majeſty of <hi>Sweden.</hi> The latter end of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> 1658. Admiral <hi>Opdam</hi> with the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet conſiſting of about 38 men of War, and 70 ſmall Merchant-men and Fluyts, upon which were embarqued 3000 Land ſouldiers, paſſed the <hi>Sound,</hi> and after a ſharp encounter with the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Fleet, arrived at <hi>Coppenha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen.</hi> Thus was <hi>Sweden</hi> engaged at the ſame time in a War with the Emperour, <hi>Pole, Brandenburger, Moſcovite, Dane,</hi> and <hi>Hollander.</hi> But this powerful arming of our Neighbour-State, awakened us in <hi>England</hi> to conſider, that we alſo had an intereſt to preſerve in the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, which we had no more reaſon to believe that the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> would do for us at his own charges, than that he would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barque himſelf in ſo expenſive a War, without expecting ſome ſatisfactory conſiderations of return from <hi>Denmark.</hi> Beſides, though we were willing to ſee <hi>Coppenhagen</hi> relieved, yet we were not ſure the <hi>Hollanders</hi> aſſiſtance would be bounded there, and could not be willing to ſee the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ruined by the combined force of ſo many Enemies.</p>
               <p>The States General made it their work and buſineſs, abſolutely to aſſiſt the <hi>Dane,</hi> and never made any overture of accommodation betwixt the two Kings, nor had as yet any publick Miniſter upon the place by whom to do it; But <hi>England</hi> ſteers in this affair ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe, propounds not a direct Aſſiſtance, but a Peace. Has no deſign to make the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> Maſter of <hi>Denmark,</hi> for on the contrary, the conſervation of <hi>Denmark</hi> is the common Intereſt both of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> But the proper Intereſt of <hi>England,</hi> was ſo to make a Peace, as not to ſuffer the <hi>Dane</hi> to be ruined by the <hi>Swede,</hi> nor to ſuffer the <hi>Swede</hi> to be ruined by the <hi>Hollander;</hi> or in the conditions of the Peace, to be ſubjected to ſuch Laws as he ſhould impoſe upon him at pleaſure; but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve <hi>Sweden</hi> not only as a ballance upon the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> which is the common intereſt of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> but as the counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe upon the Confederate Naval ſtrength of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,</hi> which is the peculiar intereſt of <hi>England.</hi> And beſides this, <hi>England</hi> had another intereſt in this Affair, <hi>viz.</hi> To enable the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſo to retire himſelf out of ſo unhappy a War, and upon ſuch equitable terms and conditions, as might have both capacitated him, and obliged him, to give us ſome reaſonable ſatisfaction and recompence, in conſideration of the great expences we were neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to be at, for the ſecuring of his intereſt, together with our own. And indeed the moſt viſible <hi>medium</hi> at that time for ſtopping the progreſs of a War betwixt <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> and taking up the differences betwixt <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> was a Fleet from <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In <hi>November</hi> 1658. A Fleet of twenty Frigats was ſea out under
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:104469:85"/>Vice-Admiral <hi>Goodſon,</hi> who coming to the height of the <hi>Scaw,</hi> found he could not enter the <hi>Cataget,</hi> for the abundance of Ice, and ſo was conſtrained to return without effecting any thing, only that this warlike appearance from <hi>England,</hi> ſtopped the 4000 men and twelve ſhips of War which were ready in the <hi>Texel,</hi> deſigned for the <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> under the command of <hi>de Ruyter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>During this, I had propoſed to both Kings, the Mediation of <hi>England,</hi> for compoſing a ſecond-time the differences betwixt the two Crowns, which both of them freely accepted. But I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver induce the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> to treat ſeperately with the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> alone, he always inſiſting upon the comprehenſion and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of all his Allies to the ſame Treaty, which was directly againſt the letter of my Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>In <hi>January</hi> 1658. A Treaty was made betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for re-eſtabliſhing a Peace betwixt the two <hi>Northern</hi> Kings, upon equitable terms. Wherein it was particularly provided, that if upon occaſion of the ſuccours ſent, or hereafter to be ſent from <hi>England</hi> to the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> in order to ſuch a Peace, a War ſhould ariſe with any other Forraign Prince or State; <hi>France</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with <hi>England,</hi> ſhould declare ſuch Prince or State their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy.</p>
               <p>The beginning of <hi>April</hi> 1659. The Fleet under General <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague</hi> arrived in the <hi>Sound.</hi> My Inſtructions, were to propound a particular Treaty betwixt the two Crowns, becauſe a general one, in order to an Univerſal Peace, would have been at that time tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and impracticable, and the Peace to be eſtabliſhed in purſuance of this particular Treaty, was to be under the conditions and qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> Treaty, as the moſt proper <hi>Medium</hi> for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moding all differences. Beſides, both <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> eſteemed it moſt honourable, to aſſert and maintain that Peace wherein they had been joint Mediators. The iſſue of my Negotiations was this. The K. of <hi>Denmark</hi> abſolutely refuſed to treat ſperately with <hi>Sweden,</hi> the K. of <hi>Sweden</hi> declares himſelf willing to treat, but not willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> Treaty, as the terms and conditions of the Peace. Pretending, that this would be tacitly to accuſe His laſt enterpriſe upon <hi>Denmark</hi> of injuſtice, for if the <hi>Dane</hi> gave the occaſion of the War, by entring into new practiſes and combinations with his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, after the former Peace made, which he avers they did (though both Kings as is uſual in ſuch caſes, highly proteſt the right of their Cauſe, and the juſtice of their Armes) then ſayes he, I ought to have better ſecurity for the future, that the <hi>Dane</hi> by an innate ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity and deſire of revenge, fomented by other States, ſtart not out upon every occaſion, to traverſe my deſigns, and work me miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, when they ſhall find me intangled in a remote War, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in <hi>Poland:</hi> eſpecially being contiguous with <hi>Sweden,</hi> and ſo moſt capable of doing me hurt. Beſides that, He pretended ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the loſs of <hi>Thoren,</hi> and a conſiderable part of <hi>Pruſsia,</hi> occaſioned by this diverſion of his Arms in <hi>Denmark;</hi> As alſo, for
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:104469:86"/>the loſs of theſe opportunities in <hi>Germany,</hi> during the vacancy of the Empire, which He might have improved by the preſence of His Army in thoſe parts, and the aſſiſtance of <hi>France</hi> and his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Allies, either to have turned aſide the Succeſſion from the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> his Hereditary Enemy, or to have capitulated ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages for himſelf with the Emperour that was to be Elected, or at leaſt wiſe to have prevented the conjunction and confederacy betwixt the now Emperour and the Electour of <hi>Brandenburg.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other difficulties lay in the way of the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> Treaty, amongſt which it was not the leaſt, that the King had already diſpoſed of to the Officers of his Court and Army, the Lands in <hi>Schonen</hi> and <hi>Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi> which by the Treaty of <hi>Rotſchild</hi> are reſerved to their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Proprietors, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Daniſh</hi> Nobility. However, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances and ſolicitations, together with the advantage of the Report, which was about this time confirmed from all hands, that the Peace betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> was intended in good earneſt, which might probably oblige <hi>England</hi> to retire home their forces for their own ſecurity, and ſlacken any aſſiſtance from <hi>France,</hi> and ſo <hi>Sweden</hi> left alone to conteſt with ſo many Enemies. His Majeſty began at laſt to hearken to the Propoſition of the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> Treaty, and by a Paper in writing ſigned by His Commiſſioners; bearing date the 21 of <hi>April,</hi> in anſwer to a former Memorial of mine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly accepted the ſaid Treaty, but then ſubjoyned to the words of acceptance, a proviſional clauſe of better ſecurity, than what was formerly granted him, by the bare diſpoſition of the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> Treaty. Which clauſe I not being ſatisfied with, as that which might be interpreted as eluſory of the fore-going words, His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſoon after declared to me, that as to point of future ſecurity, He would acquieſs in the ſpecial Garranty of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> which I had power alſo to offer Him on the part of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In purſuance of the Inſtructions ſent upon the Fleet under Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Mountague,</hi> and the better to facilitate the work of the Peace, by engaging the States General to act in Conſort with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> A Treaty was concluded at the <hi>Hague</hi> the 11 of <hi>May,</hi> 1659. Betwixt the three States, in order to re-eſtabliſh a Peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two <hi>Northern</hi> Kings, upon the root and foundation of the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> Treaty. There Weeks time was limited to the Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the publick Miniſters upon the place, after the expiration of which Term, neither <hi>England</hi> nor the States, were to aſſiſt either of the Kings who ſhould refuſe the Peace, during his refuſal. The King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> though unbeknown to the States General, had already aſſented to treat upon the foot and foundation of the <hi>Rotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child</hi> Treaty, his ſafe Conducts prepared, his Commiſſioners no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated; I as Mediator, propounded <hi>Fredericksburg</hi> for the place of the Treaty, which the King alſo accepted. The <hi>Dutch</hi> Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Extraordinary from the States General to the two Kings, who arrived about this time, made their inſtances and applications to his Majeſty of <hi>Denmark</hi> (as I had formerly alſo done) to draw from
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:104469:86"/>him a ſuitable concurrence to the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> Treaty. But that King ſtill perſiſted in the ſame reſolution, not to treat ſeparately, but propounded an Univerſal Treaty, at which the Miniſters of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Allies and Confederates might be preſent; and to this end, nominated <hi>Lubec</hi> for the place of a general Aſſembly. I ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged upon the <hi>Dutch</hi> Deputies, the fourth Article of the Treaty of the <hi>Hague,</hi> wherein 'tis covenanted; that no aſſiſtance was to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to the Prince that ſhould refuſe a Peace upon juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conditions, which reaſonable conditions are by the firſt Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle to be expounded the Treaty at <hi>Rotſchild.</hi> Now he who refuſes to treat (which in this caſe, according to the ſenſe of the three Eſtates was to treat ſeparately) refuſes a Peace upon what conditions ſoever.</p>
               <p>The Deputies were at accord with me, that His Majeſty of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark</hi> continuing in that reſolution, their Fleets could no longer aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him, and wrote to General <hi>Opdam</hi> their Commander in chief, to the ſame effect; who at that time was with his Fleet in the <hi>Belt.</hi> He notwithſtanding continued ſtill to favour under-hand the <hi>Dane,</hi> but durſt not ſo vigorouſly and openly aſſiſt him, as otherwiſe he would, partly by reaſon of the contrary Adviſe and Orders which he had received from the Deputies of the States, but more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, becauſe over-awed by the preſence of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet.</p>
               <p>This ſuſpenſion of Aſſiſtance on the part of the <hi>Hollander,</hi> though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet remained Neutral and acted nothing, onely obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the other to the performance of Covenants, gave the <hi>Swede</hi> ſome conſiderable advantages, who upon this opportunity, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Iſles of <hi>Moenen, Falſter,</hi> and <hi>Laland,</hi> together with the capital Town of <hi>Naskow</hi> under his obedience. The truth is, the <hi>Dutch</hi> Deputies found themſelves engaged in ſome difficulties, for whereas they ſuppoſed that the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> would have been the refuſer of the <hi>Treaty,</hi> and conſequently the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fleet bound up from giving him any Aſſiſtance (which was the main thing they aimed at) and the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> the accepter, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet at liberty to aſſiſt him, they found the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and ſo had tied up their own hands, by their <hi>Treaty</hi> made at the <hi>Hague.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the ſtate of Affairs in the <hi>Northern</hi> parts, at the time of the Change of the Government here in <hi>England,</hi> and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments being reſtored to their former authority. And this was the true ſeaſon of ripening things to a concluſion, and if the Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had continued ſtill in the ſame train and method, that is, if the Parliament had either immediately ſent new powers to me, to act according to my former Inſtructions, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Rotſchild Treaty;</hi> or forthwith diſpatched ſome other perſon or perſons to purſue the ſame, it had certainly iſſued to a Peace. For <hi>England, France, Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> yea and <hi>Holland</hi> too, being at accord concerning the <hi>Medium</hi> of the Peace, it was not poſsible that the <hi>Dane</hi> ſhould ſtand it out long. But no perſons appearing from <hi>England,</hi> and I having no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:104469:87"/>from the Parliament, the Dutch Deputies began to ſeek evaſions. When I urged upon them, that they ought not to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the refuſing King; their only Reply was this, that by the firſt Article of the <hi>Treaty</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> the Miniſters upon the place were to uſe their utmoſt diligence and endeavour with both the Kings, which, ſaid they, I had done with the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> but not with the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> which was a meer ſhift, becauſe they knew I could not at that time go to <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> being deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Creditives. And now they held themſelves no longer obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the <hi>Treaty</hi> at the <hi>Hague,</hi> but <hi>de Ruyter</hi> with a new Fleet of forty men of War enters the <hi>Belt,</hi> joyns with Admiral <hi>Opdam,</hi> paſſes on to <hi>Coppenhagen,</hi> all which was expreſly againſt the letter of the ſaid <hi>Treaty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True it is, that about the middle of <hi>June</hi> 1659, I received a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the Councel of State, directed to my ſelf; authorizing me to continue my Negotiation with the two Kings as formerly, till further order from the Parliament or Councel of State, but I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had Creditives nor Commiſsion, nor any thing to exhibit to either of the Kings, whereby to conſtitute and legitimate me, as the publick Miniſter of this Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>And now the Negotiation for the Peace was at a long pauſe, and our Fleet in the mean time at an Anchor in the <hi>Sound.</hi> Only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe His Majeſty of <hi>Denmark</hi> had always inſiſted upon an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal <hi>Treaty,</hi> in reference to a general Peace, His Majeſty of <hi>Sweden</hi> gave me a Declaration in writing, which I ſent to the Councel of State <hi>June</hi> the 28, in which he alſo declared himſelf willing to treat a general Peace.</p>
               <p>This he did of his own accord, not at my inſtance, for all my Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions directad me only to a particular <hi>Treaty</hi> betwixt the 2 Crowns. His Majeſty told me moreover, that in caſe <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi> would obtain for him a general Peace, in which ſaid Peace he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to himſelf no more, than that things betwixt Him, the Emperour, and the Electour of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> ſhould return to their former eſtate without any further demands on either ſide; and for the <hi>Pole,</hi> he ſhould only give him ſome equitable recompence for the places he ſhould ſurrender to him in <hi>Pruſs.</hi> He would not only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Dane to the <hi>Rotſchild Treaty,</hi> but releaſe ſomething conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in the ſaid <hi>Treaty,</hi> in conſideration of a general Peace. But in caſe of a ſeparate <hi>Treaty</hi> with <hi>Denmark,</hi> he would remit nothing of the <hi>Rotſchild Treaty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The 20. of <hi>July</hi> 1659. The Commiſsioners Plenipotentiary arrived in the <hi>Sound,</hi> which was three months after the Change of the Government here in <hi>England,</hi> I was put out of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the Mediation, and had Creditives ſent me only as Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. A little before this, <hi>viz.</hi> the fourth of the ſaid Moneth, a new <hi>Treaty</hi> was made at the <hi>Hague,</hi> by which the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was to reſtore, not only what he had gaine upon the Dane by this laſt War, but alſo the Iſland of <hi>Bruntholm,</hi> with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:104469:87"/>of <hi>Drontheym</hi> in <hi>Norway,</hi> with all its appurtenances, a Country of near 200 <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles extent, which was formerly granted him by the <hi>Rotſchild Treaty,</hi> and by authentick Acts of State incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Crown of <hi>Sweden:</hi> Beſides the remiſſion of the 400000 Ryxdollers, which the <hi>Dane</hi> had formerly promiſed to pay for ſatisfaction of damages, done to the <hi>Swede</hi> in <hi>Guinea.</hi> The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was alſo to admit the States General to the <hi>Treaty</hi> made at <hi>Elbing,</hi> and the Elucidations thereof made at <hi>Thoren,</hi> and both States, <hi>viz. England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> reciprocally oblige themſelves, not only not to aſſiſt the refuſer, but to compel by joynt force of Arms, to an acceptance of the foreſaid conditions. And thus the State of Affairs was quite altered, and new obſtacles interpoſed in the way of the Peace. For,
<list>
                     <item>I. Both Kings were highly diſ-ſatisfied with this manner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. For whereas the firſt <hi>Treaty</hi> at the <hi>Hague</hi> of the eleventh of <hi>May,</hi> was never propounded to either of the Kings as that which ſhould bind or oblige them, but only made uſe of by Me as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Inſtruction; this was not only publikely propounded, but was to be obtruded by a compulſory force, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> making themſelves not Mediators, but Umpires and Arbitrators of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel betwixt the two Kings, which they interpreted to a diminution of their Soveraignty, by erecting a ſuperiority over them. But the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was moſt of all diſguſted, becauſe <hi>England</hi> without any concert or communication had with him, enters into a <hi>Treaty</hi> with his open Enemies (for ſo at that time he reputed the States General) to impoſe upon him by a conjoint force, Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which he judges altogether unreaſonable.</item>
                     <item>II. Whereas the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had already accepted of the <hi>Rotſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child Treaty,</hi> conform to the Agreement made at the <hi>Hague</hi> of the eleventh of <hi>May</hi> (though not under the notion and formality of the <hi>Treaty</hi> at the <hi>Hague</hi> as obligatory upon him) but as the counſel and advice of <hi>England</hi> his faithful Allies, and upon the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s refuſal, had in proſecution of the War gained notable advantages upon him; the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> expected both to have profited by his acceptance of the Peace, at the inſtance of <hi>England,</hi> and by the advantages of the War, he having after the refuſal of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> reduced <hi>Moenen, Falſter,</hi> and <hi>Laland.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as a new <hi>Treaty</hi> is made at the <hi>Hague</hi> of the fourth of <hi>July,</hi> in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the accepting King, to clog the Peace on his part with new and burdenſome conditions, and theſe to be forcibly impoſed upon him, in favour of the Refuſer. Beſides that, <hi>England</hi> recoils from their own Agreement; and ſayes the King, as they have made a ſecond, ſo they may ſtill make a third, and a fourth <hi>Treaty</hi> at the <hi>Hague.</hi>
                     </item>

                        <pb n="144" facs="tcp:104469:88"/>III. The tedious and unneceſſary delayes which have been uſed, have been a great obſtruction in the way of the Peace. For if the Peace betwixt the two Crowns had been concluded in the <hi>Spring</hi> of the year, the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had had time enough to have tranſported his Army into <hi>Pomeren,</hi> to have taken the Campagn there, to have prevented the infal of the Imperial Army, and to have provided Winter quarters for his Troops. But the Summer being almoſt paſs'd, before the arrival of the Plenipotentiaries, and the Peace to be begun anew upon another foot, which would neceſſarily require ſome longer time. The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> was to ſeek what to have done with his Army; to disband them was not reaſonable, becauſe though he had made Peace with <hi>Denmark,</hi> yet he had ſtill War with the Emperour, <hi>Pole,</hi> and <hi>Brandenburger.</hi> In <hi>Sweden</hi> there was no ſubſiſtence for them, to tranſport them into <hi>Pomeren,</hi> and there take the Field, he could not, for the Imperial Army was much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour to his in ſtrength, and had already ſeized the principal Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Country, and was abſolutely Maſter of the Campagne. And to have put them into Gariſons, which above two parts in three conſiſted of Horſe, the want of forage had ruined them in few days. So that now the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> holds cloſe to <hi>Denmark;</hi> Firſt, as a quarter to his Troops. Secondly, as a place of refuge and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, putting himſelf upon the Defenſive, as it were intrenched within thoſe Iſlands, not having ſtrength ſufficient to appear before his Enemy upon the <hi>Terra firma.</hi> Thirdly, as a Gage or Pledge for the reſtitution of what he had loſt in <hi>Pomeren.</hi> And I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe that as things now ſtand, the War betwixt <hi>Denmark</hi> and <hi>Sweden</hi> will hardly be accommodated but by a general Peace.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, I humbly conceive that <hi>England</hi> in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of this buſineſs, hath departed from their proper Intereſt, and that upon theſe following grounds.</p>
               <p n="1">I. We have wholly diſ-obliged the <hi>Swede</hi> who is <hi>Englands</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe againſt the <hi>Dane</hi> and <hi>Hollander,</hi> The <hi>Hollander</hi> is ſure that the <hi>Dane</hi> will alwayes ſide with him againſt <hi>England,</hi> witneſs the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of our Merchant-men in the <hi>Sound,</hi> in 1653. We ought to be as ſure of the <hi>Swede,</hi> and though not to aſſiſt him in the conqueſt of <hi>Denmark,</hi> yet ſo to have managed the buſineſs of a Peace, as to have firmly engaged him in our Intereſts.</p>
               <p n="2">II. We have loſt our reputation; It had been honourable for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to have maintained the <hi>Rotſchild</hi> Treaty, in which we were Mediators. But to equip a mighty Fleet of forty of our beſt men of War, and to keep them out at Sea ſix Months together, to the amazement of all our Neighbouring States, without effecting any
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:104469:88"/>thing, failing of our End and Deſign, is wholly inglorious.</p>
               <p n="3">III. We have loſt our Expences. The King of <hi>Sweden</hi> never ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that <hi>England</hi> would be at all thoſe vaſt charges, without expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting any return from him, but freely propounded ſeveral advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in point of Trade and Commerce by way of recompence, and amongſt others, propounded that the Pitch and Tar, and the whole growth and production of <hi>Sweden,</hi> which is for the apparel and equipage of Shipping, ſhould be ſold at a regulated price to <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants only, by which means <hi>London</hi> might have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Staple of thoſe Commodities. But we on the contrary, have barr'd our ſelves from accepting any thing of priviledge or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, though it be only <hi>ratione oneris,</hi> upon the accompt of our expences, and ſo to be conſidered as a re-imburſement. For by the Agreement of the <hi>Hague</hi> of the fourth of <hi>July, England</hi> is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> to admit the States General to the <hi>Treaty</hi> at <hi>Elbing.</hi> And by the expreſs letter of the <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Elbing,</hi> the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> is obliged to admit the people of the <hi>United Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlands,</hi> to the ſame priviledges and advantages which he either hath, or ſhall hereafter grant, to any other Forraign Nation what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. We oblige cour ſelves, to force the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> to admit the States General to the <hi>Elbing Treaty,</hi> notwithſtanding that by that <hi>Treaty</hi> the former <hi>Treaties</hi> made betwixt Queen <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> and the States General, one at <hi>Stockholm</hi> 1640, and the other at <hi>Suderacre</hi> 1645, are expreſly renewed and re-confirmed. Both which are <hi>Treaties</hi> of mutual Defence, and by vertue of which, in caſe <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> become hereafter engaged in a War againſt <hi>Holland,</hi> the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> will be obliged to aſſiſt <hi>Holland</hi> againſt us, with four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men at his own charges.</p>
               <p n="5">V. We have loſt our Opportunity of making the Peace. <hi>England</hi> was once in a manner Arbitrator of this whole affair. <hi>England</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds the <hi>Rotſchild Treaty</hi> as the Medium of the Peace, <hi>Holland</hi> though very unwilling, yet is neceſſitated to aſſent thereto. For to think that <hi>Holland,</hi> who was in actual War with <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> would at the ſame time break with <hi>England,</hi> when back'd with <hi>France,</hi> eſpecially his moſt confident Ally the <hi>Dane,</hi> being reduced to that extremity, as to become inſtead of a help, a charge and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, is to ſuppoſe that which is Morally and Politically impoſſible. But as the caſe now ſtands, <hi>England</hi> is the leaſt in this buſineſs, all that we pretend to, is to be included in the States Generals Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Elbing,</hi> wherein they are Principals, and we but Acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſories.</p>
               <p n="6">
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:104469:89"/>VI. We play advantages into the hands of the <hi>Hollander</hi> our Rival State, and that only which ſtands in the eye and aym of <hi>England</hi>'s greatneſs. For beſides the Treaty of <hi>Elbing,</hi> which we engage to obtain for him. The <hi>Hollander</hi> obliges us alſo to ſee <hi>Drontheym</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the <hi>Dane.</hi> In which the <hi>Hollander</hi> conſults his own uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, for <hi>Schonen</hi> is the Country, which the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> would have reſtored, but the <hi>Hollander</hi> profits more by <hi>Drontheym,</hi> when in the King of <hi>Denmark</hi>'s hands, than the King of <hi>Denmark</hi> himſelf; both in point of Trade, and in Levies of Men: For, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the late War betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> had ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome leſs than two or three thouſand of thoſe <hi>Norwegians</hi> in the ſervice of their Fleets. Beſides that, the greateſt part or the whole of the Revenue of <hi>Drontheym,</hi> is oppignorated to the Merchants of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> for debt. And indeed, the whole Kingdom of <hi>Denmark</hi> is become ſo obnoxious, upon the accompt of vaſt Debts, that it is in a manner at the diſpoſition of <hi>Holland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The States General have ſteered an even and direct courſe to their Intereſt. They have maintained their Ally, they have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecured <hi>Denmark</hi> from the power of <hi>Sweden,</hi> but ſecured it to themſelves; And being ſecure of <hi>Denmark,</hi> are now aſſuring <hi>Sweden</hi> to themſelves alſo; having already weakened the near A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and correſpondence which was betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Sweden.</hi> Whereas we, after all our Expences, are ſo far from being ſure of the friendſhip of either of the Kings, that we are ſure of the ill-will of both; Of the <hi>Dane,</hi> for appearing with an armed Fleet in the Intereſts of <hi>Sweden;</hi> of the <hi>Swede,</hi> for no ſooner appearing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting him. They have alſo obtained their Treaty at <hi>Elbing,</hi> which in rigour of juſtice they could not pretend to, for they themſelves formerly refuſed to ratifie it in due time. And to crown all, they have heightened their reputation, by rendring themſelves Maſters of their Deſign. We on the contrary, have loſt our Friend, loſt our Expences, loſt our Buſineſs, loſt our Reputation; From whence I conclude, that in the management of this Affair, we in <hi>England</hi> have departed from Our proper Intereſt.</p>
